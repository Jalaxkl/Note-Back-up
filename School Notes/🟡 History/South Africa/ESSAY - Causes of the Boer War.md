# Thesis: "This essay examines the Boer War with its diverse range of causes driven by the effects of British imperialism, economic interests, and political misunderstandings"


The Southern African Boer War during the years 1899-1902 between the Boers and British colonizers and settlers. In the earlier years of the 19th century, Britain wanted to consolidate all of Southern Africa under one flag. This led to high tensions when, in 1830, Britain abolished slavery, and in response, the Boers packed up and moved into the African Interior. Then, in 1870, massive quantities of rare earth minerals were found, and to manage the vast numbers of people, the Boers established a government in opposition to the British. This essay examines the Boer War with its diverse range of causes driven by the effects of British imperialism and political misunderstandings.

The effects of the British imperialist government greatly affected the start of the 2nd Boer War. The British colonial policy impressed upon the idea of a "Greater Britain" which sought to expand the influence and control of the British in Africa. British Empire sought to establish a centralized government in Southern Africa for their control of its resources and people. The expansionist attitude contributed to increased tensions between the Boer Republic and Britain. This attitude toward the whole of Africa is significant as it shows the intentions of the British. The colonial policy would help connect the northern territories of Britain and the southern Cape Colonies. Policy aimed towards the Boer Republic to allow Britain to have territorial continuity and efficient movement of troops. Additionally, it is worth noting that the colonial policy would allow for greater strategic influence in the region with competing European colonies, specifically Germany. Causing further tensions in the region as Germany was supplying the Boer Republic with state-of-the-art weapons and wartime equipment in the lead-up to the war. This shows the international tensions throughout the Boer Republic. Britain would view this as a breach of diplomatic normalities and a hostile act. While not only allowing the Boers to have a fighting chance this also undermined British authority in the region. The breach of diplomatic normality shows the significance of the tensions brewing in Southern Cape Colonies and the lingering resentment toward Germany. Overall, it's clear that British imperialism and their colonial policy were a large factor in the causation of the 2nd Boer War. 

Finally, the two nations' miscommunications and assumptions about one another affected the start of the 2nd Boer War. During the time of high tensions, the British High Commissioner, Lord Milner, in the southern Cape colonies ordered around 50,000 troops. The reason for this order of troops was for self-protection. Due to the hostilities, the British deemed it useful to have troops stationed nearby in case of a future conflict. While a great initial decision, the Boers had something to say about the massing of troops; the Boers viewed it as an act of aggression toward their Republic. The leader of the Boer Republic, Paul Kruger, heavily believed that Britain was trying to re-take the land they held most dear, and in reaction to the British amassing forces, Kruger sent an ultimatum to the British. The ultimatum stated that the British needed to remove their troops from Southern Africa and if they failed to do so the Boers would attack. This is significant as it shows the Boers' need for cultural identity, the Boers wanted their land so they could live without the disruptions and distractions of the British. This is in opposition to what the British wanted, they wanted control of Southern Africa and to unite their colonies. Ultimately the factor in the causation of the war boils down to the misunderstanding and misinterpretations of the opposition's actions. While the British wanted the mitigation of an armed force against them, this was viewed with hostility from the Boers. Additionally, the Boers wanted autonomy from the British while the British were only somewhat willing to give it to them. 

From some perspectives, the factors leading to the Boer War may seem equal in importance because they all contributed to its beginning. However, there were extremely diverse causes of the Second Boer War. Ranging from cultural differences to political and economic, each with its values and limitations in causing the war. It can be argued while the immediate cause of the was from the ultimatum by the Boers it should not be understated that the political tensions in the region were high from the effects of the British colonial policy. Additionally, the alliance of Germany and the Boers as well as the addition of British troops in the regions created the perfect recipe for a conflict. In summation, the causes of the Boer War were driven by the effects of British imperialism and political misunderstandings.

I noticed in re-reading my essay is that I sometimes make analysis extremely messy and follow a convoluted order. Finally, I could also work on my organization, I feel as if I do not have an organized essay, while it is structured it does not appear to be very organized. In terms of effectiveness I would say my essay is on the lower side of effectiveness, it gets the point across but not in the best possible way it could.
