# Causes of the 2nd Boer War

1. **Queen Victoria** wanted to *unite all of South Africa* under one flag 
	- Also wanted the wealth that could be found in South Africa. 
	- British colonial policy influenced decisions to attack the Boers 

2. Due to fears the British High (**Lord Milner**) commissioner *ordered 50,000 troops* (overall 450,000 were sent) 
	- This was viewed as a act of war by the Boers so **Kruger** sent an ultimatum or they would attack. 
	- Subsequently, the British thought this was a joke so they did nothing 
		- The Boer *attacked at the end of the ultimatum* 
	- The British saw responding defeats from the Boers 

3. *Border disputes* over land rights, taxes and territories were common and created *high tensions between the two groups* 
	- Mainly instigated by bobs or **Lord Roberts**

4. Ultimately *miscommunication and misunderstandings* of the two caused the most problems
	- Britain brought troops for protection ---> boers view this as an attack 
	- Boers wanted cultural identity ---> Britain wanted control 

5. Disease caused the death of many cattle and this caused tensions

# Notes: What is important?
- Queen Victoria wanted to unite all of South Africa but the Boers did not like that 

- When slavery was abolished (1870) in the cape the boers packed up and moved interior and founded the gold city of Johannesburg 

- British high commissioner was scared and thought the boers were going to attack so the British government send 450,000 troops 
	- Kruger was skeptical and saw this as an act to take over his country 

- Kruger sent an ultimatum to tell the British to get the troops out, and once it expired the boers moved to attack the British
	- Britain sent 50,000 troops against the Boers

- The British view this as a joke and thought it was going to be an easy win 
	- Lost 2,500 men in 5 days 
	- Sent 100,000 new troops to South Africa, especially those with horses 

- More British troops died of disease within the cities than Boer bullets 

- Eventually due to sheer numbers the British managed to relive the sieged cities and chase the boers away
	- Eventually taking Johannesburg 

- The boers adopted guerrilla warfare as their strategy and the British started using the scored earth policy 
	- Destroyed farms, livestock and anyway the boers could sustain their campaign

### Concentration camps 
- Put the women and children in these camps 
- Sanitary systems was terrible 
- Death rate was 34% annually 
	- Eventually this was fixed to only 2% 

- Overtime the British government did not allow use of the concentration camps but still allowed the scored earth policy to continue so that Boer civilians were stranded in the bush 
	- This inadvertently caused more damage cause the families were in real time affected and could be attacked by a local tribe
