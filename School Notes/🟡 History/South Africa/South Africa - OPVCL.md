# Written response 


The book "A history of South Africa" by Leonard Thompson, born in England in 1916 and educated at Oxford University and became a Rhodes Scholar. In 1990 publishing the first edition too "A history of South Africa" and again in 2014 he publishing his last edition before his untimely death. With the help of Lynn Bert and the Yale University Press in the United States we now have a overview of South African History. It was difficult to find a book that was not written by a author who had a strong opinion on the Apartheid regime, this would lead to bias in information and truth. This book was written for the general public to inform them on what South Africa and its history truly looked liked from the years 300 AD all the way until 2014. The author uses a timeline along with illustrations and photographs to help show the history and show examples from the time period. Because the historical book was revised again in 2014 with the help of Leonard Dooly, William Foltz to name a few as well as Charles Grench and Laura Dooly from Yale university press. Some of the values of the revised version its easier to step back and see more of the causes and effects of events which gives you a strong overview. This would create less bias because of the length of time from when the event occurred. Additionally, with such a general overview of the complexities of South African history this limits the specification of the knowledge that can be found. This also leads to a more limited perspective because with a smaller group you have less knowledge that can be gathered, leading to less specification of knowledge.
