# Practices of War and their Impact on its Outcome
## Technological Dev: 

### Air:
- Increased tech in wireless technologies 

- **Radar** was developed and used to see income aircraft 
	- Can be used defensively 
	- *Anti radar*: Bullets with metal chuff 
	- *Radar detectors* for planes 
	- Sonar on planes for finding *ships at sea* 

- British could outproduce German aircraft in a rate of 25:7 (Hurricane to BF-109)
- British Spitfire was superior to BF-109 German aircraft 

Rocket power:
- Germans invented the rocket 
	- Essentially a bomb with a rocket attacked 
	- V1: Extremely explosive but not accurate, 8500 were used about half destroyed before landing 
	- v2: Ballistic Missile so 6x faster 1,300 attacked London 

- Long ranged bombers 
	- Mainly the *Avro Lancaster* of British make 
		- 4,000 km range : 14 1000 lb bombs 
	- B-17 Flying fortress 
		- 12,000 produced during the war 
		- range of 3,000 km ; 2-3,600 lb of bombs 
		- Dropped 40% of all bombs during the war
	- B-24 liberator 
		- Set to replace the B-17 
		- Larger payload less range 
	- B-29
		- Most advanced (only used in the pacific)
		- pressure cockpit 
		- higher ceiling of flying

### Sea:
- Better *amphibious landing craft* were created for D-day

- in the US 1 liberty ship for supplies for would created *every 3* days at its peak 
- Rebuilt the pacific fleet in under 5 years 
- Due to the threat of U-boats development of sonar and anti-sub tech was developed

- Germans ditched the traditional battleship route 
	- Went for U-boats instead 
		- Peak of 300 vessels in 1942
		- Developed the 'Wolfpack' strategy

- Anti- Submarine warfare:
	- Hydrophones 
	- Depth charges (the hedgehog) 
	- Magnetic detectors

### Land:

#### Code breaking:
- Enigma 
	- German Invention 
	- Had many combinations 
	- needed a code book to decipher 

- Deciphered by the help of Alan Turing 
	- Developed a machine known as Ultra 
	- deciphered 2,000 messages a day 

- Allies had to act on others and not at all on others 

- Using the battles from **WW1 as inspiration** *Germany* increased its military doctrine and studied to become better 
- **Blitzkrieg** 
	- Commonly known as the lightning war 
	- Largest tactical advantage for Germany 
	- Dive bombing was invented by Germany 
		- Key point: Ground and air worked together 
	- Was extremely useful with large areas of open land 
- Strategy: 
	- Take over central Europe 
	- Invade Poland to not have a rear guard enemy 
	- Take care of France 
	- Take car of Britain RAF 
	- Invade USSR for oil 
	- Invade UK

- Allied Strategy for WW2
	- Italy was eliminated quickly 
	- Defeat Germany before Japan 
		- Didn't want Germany to create an atomic bomb 
	- Use strategic bombing as much as possible 
	- Hold colonies in the pacific 
- Overall: 
	- Outproduce the enemy and let them take the casualties 

- Red Army development of the T-34 tank 
	- Extremely feared and hard to kill 

#### Lend Lease act 
- 50 Billion USD of material to China, UK, USSR, between 41-45
- Before the start of the war

## Extent of mobilization 

### Economic:
- *Germany* was spending 15% of its GNP on military spending 
- Did not sacrifice cosmetic goods for wartime material
	- German economy was not designed for a long and arduos war 

- France relied heavily on the Maginot Line to help defend France in case of attack
- during **1914-1918** spent 50% of its GDP on paying off debts 

- *USA* economic powerhouse 
	- 36 Billion yards of cloth 
	- 41 Billion pounds of ammunition 
	- 1943 a liberty ship was being completed every 3 days 

*Soviet Union* 
- Had large quantities of material and moved their factories close by 
- Could produce 54,000 tanks 

- *Japan* decentralized its production for less effective bombings 

### Human resources:
- 1939: *Germany* had over 3 million troops 
	- 2400 tanks 
	- 4000 aircraft 

- France had as estimation of 5 million in reserve (they did not)
- could only muster 90 divisions of infantry and did not have any separate tank divisions 

- *Britain* in **1940** had about 1.6 Million Men on the island 
- RAF had 900 bombers and 600 fighters 
- Royal Navy was still largest in the world 
	- Streatched thin

## Foreign Powers

#### Result:
- 60% of French territory to Germany 
- Rest 40% would be a puppet state 
- French army reduced to 100K men 
- French POW were kept and no hope of release 
- French would pay 'occupational costs'
- French handed over their navy to Germany
