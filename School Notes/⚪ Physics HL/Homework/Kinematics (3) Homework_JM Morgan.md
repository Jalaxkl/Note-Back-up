# Overview 
- [x] Present raw and processed data in appropriate data tables. **Table 1**
- [x] Generate an appropriate graph of displacement against time. **Graph 1**
- [x] Linearize your graph if required. **Graph 1 (linearized)**
- [x] Deduce an appropriate equation which represents the relationship between displacement and time for an object moving at constant acceleration. **Equation 1**
- [x] Use your graph of displacement against time to calculate the instantaneous velocity of the cart at five different intervals and tabulate this data. **Date points 1**
- [x] Generate a graph of velocity against time from this data. **Graph 2**
- [x] Deduce an appropriate equation which represents the relationship between velocity and time for an object moving at constant acceleration.**Equation 2**
