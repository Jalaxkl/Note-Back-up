- [x] Process the raw data and present your data in an appropriate data table. **(Table 1)**
- [x] Generate an appropriate graph of displacement against time **(Graph 1).**
- [x] Analysis **Graph 1** and deduce an appropriate equation which represents the relationship between displacement and time for an object moving at constant velocity.
- [x] From the analysis of **Graph 1,** create a data table for the *velocity* of the dynamics cart as a function of time **(Table 3).**
- [x] Use the data from Table 3 to generate **Graph 2.**

## Anyalsis of Graph 1:

y = mx

y - Displacement 
x - Time 

$$ 
Slope = \frac{Δy}{Δx} = \frac{Δdisplacement}{Δtime} = \frac{m}{s} = Velocity 
$$
Slope is contant = constant velocity
