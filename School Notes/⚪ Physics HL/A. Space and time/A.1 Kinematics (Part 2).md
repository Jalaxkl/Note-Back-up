# 2D Projectile Motion 

### 2D: 
- Something that has in two perpendicular axis (x and y)
### Projectile:
- Any object with the force of gravity acting on it

## Projectile Motion  
*Definition*: Movement of an object in both horizontal and vertical where gravity is the only force present 
*Simple words*: Free fall with horizontal stuff
*Acceleration of a projectile*: is ALWAYS **9.81**

- X axis velocity is always constant 
	- Because there is nothing adding or subtracting on the x-axis


#### How to solve (tips)

- X axis acceleration is ALWAYS 0ms^-2
- Y axis acceleration is ALWAYS 9.81ms^-2

- You should have two SUVAT tables for each *independent* parts (X and Y)
- *Time* is the only variable that **stays the same** 
	- The only one that can move across tables 
		- Otherwise you cant carry over values
