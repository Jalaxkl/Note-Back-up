# Measurement Uncertainty 

#### Is the result of imprecision in measuring devices. All measuring devices have some degree of uncertainty. 

## How to find?

- The larger limit of the instrument (half the smallest increment) Multiplied by the number of measurements taken. 

- A justified estimation of the limit of the measurement procedures as done by the experimenter. 

## Notes 

- When calculating precision it directly correlates into the uncertainty and thus the error bars

## Graphical Analysis 
- *Precision*: How close your date points are together
	- In your raw date table the differences between the ALL trials, how similar or different are they to one another (whats their range)
	- Graph: How large is the uncertainty compared to the data values (size of the error bars)
	- Look at your r^2 value. How close does your trendline intercept with the date points (you want as close to 1 as possible)
	- Does your trendline or best fit lie go through ALL of your date points on the graph

- *Accuracy*: How close you get to the accepted or actual value  
	- **Percentage discrepancy**: $$ \frac{|Actual-exp|}{ actual}*100$$
	- ^ thats how you find basically the percentage that there was an error
	- **Percentage Uncertainty** $$
	 slope = k =spring constant ->δk = \frac {Mmax-Mmin}{2} 
	-> \frac{δk}{k}*100 = Percent δ  $$
	- Accuracy is high is found when the **Percentage discrepancy** is *smaller* than the **Percentage Uncertainty** 
	- %discrepancy < %uncertainty 
		- If not true there must have been an error with the system, like a technique or the tools using to measure. 


## Analoge vs Digital 

### Digital:

- Find the smallest increment and since usually you have 2 places you are measuring (ex: tip and end of a pencil) 

- Uncertainty is half the original x the number of measurements

### Digital: 

- The Uncertainty will be +-1 of the last significant number reading

## Absolute, Fractional, and Percent Uncertainty 

### Absolute 
*Definition*: Uncertainty expressed as a number independent of the original number 
- Absolute Uncertainty

### Fractional:
*Definition*: Uncertainty expressed as a fraction of the original number 
- Relative Uncertainty 

### Percent: 
*Definition*: Uncertainty expressed as percentage of the original number 
- Relative Uncertainty
