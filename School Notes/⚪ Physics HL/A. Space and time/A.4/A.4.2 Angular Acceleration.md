## Angular Acceleration 
*Definition*: Acceleration which in a circular path 
*Simple words*: The acceleration in a rotating system 
*Units*: α
*Equation*: $$
α= \frac{ωf-ωi}{t}
$$
Can also use Linear Kinematic **kinematic equations** and transform them to rotational mechanics
$$ V=u+a*t.....ωf=ωi+α*t$$ 
$$s = u*t+\frac{1}{2}a*t^2...θ=ωi*t+\frac{1}{2}*α*t^2 $$

Furthermore *if you have the linear acceleration you can find the angular*
$$
α=\frac{a}{r}
$$
Where r is the distance from the fulcrum 


## Moment of Inertia 
*Definition*: is a property of a rotating system where it has resistance to angular acceleration
*Simple words*: Similar to that of liner inertia 
*Equation*:$$
τ=mr^{2}*α ....τ=I*α....I=mr^2
$$
Another Equation:
$$
τ=I* \frac{Δω}{Δt}
$$


α= Alpha of Angular acceleration 
I = (Capital i) is the Moment of Inertia

**There might be certain masses and different equations associated with different shaped objects (Will be given to you)**



##  Angular Momentum (L)
*Definition*: 
*Simple words*: Happen with both collisions and explosions 
*Units*: kgm^2s^-1
*Equation*:$$
τ=\frac{ΔL}{Δt}.... ΔL=τ*Δt
$$
Another Equation 
$$ L=I*ω$$
