# Overview:
Students will understand:

- Newton's second law of motion

Students will be able to:

- Use Newton's second law of motion both qualitatively and quantitatively.
- Solving problems involving forces and determining resultant force.


# Newtons Second Law 
The Law States: **Acceleration of a body is proportional to the resultant force causing its acceleration and is in the same direction** 

- Mass stays *constant*
- Acceleration is *directly proportional* to the **Net force** 

- Can also be expressed in change in **momentum** 

$$
Fnet = m*a =\frac{m*Δv}{ t}= \frac{m(v-u)}{t}... Fnet = \frac{Δp}{t}... ΔP=Fnet*t
$$

ΔP= Fnet * t Is also known as impluse 

**the change in momentum is the force applied per unit time**

## Net Force 
*Definition*: Sum total of all forces acting on the object 
*Simple words*: Adding all vectors and forces together
*Equation*: 
$$ 
Fnet = m*a
$$

## Linear Momentum 
*Definition*: 
*Simple words*: Any object that has both mass and velocity has Momentum
*Units*: kgms^-1
*Alternative Unit*: Ns (Newton seconds)
*Equation*: Symbol: p (lowercase)$$ 
p=m*v
$$
Change in Momentum:
$$
Δp=Δt*f
$$

## Impulse
*Definition*: 
*Simple words*: The change in momentum: ΔP
*Units*: ΔP
*Equation*: $$ 
\frac{Δp}{t}= ma = Fnet... Δp = Fnet*t 
$$
*Easier Equation*:
$$
Force = \frac{ΔP}{Time}... ΔP = Impluse= Fav*t=M(v-u)
$$

# Law of Conservation of Momentum
 
## Conservation of Momentum 
*Definition*: In any collision or explosion, momentum is conserved (no change in)
*Simple words*: 

- The total momentum before the interaction is the same as the total momentum after the collision 


## Collisions
### Elastic 
*Definition*: These are collisions between object (A and B) where the objects DO NOT STICK TOGETHER after they have collided 
*Simple words*: Bounding together and then bounce off 
*Equation*: $$
Pi= Pf ... I(Pa+Pb)=F(Pa+Pb)
$$
Total Momentum before an action = Total Momentum after an action 


### In-Elastic 
*Definition*:
*Simple words*: 
*Units*: 
*Measured with:* 
*Equation*:

# Energy loss 

## Kinetic Energy 
*Definition*: When an object is in motion it has kinetic energy 
*Simple words*: energy to have things move
*Units*: Joules (j)
*Equation*: $$ 
J = \frac{1}{2}*M*v^2
$$
Another Equation with Kinetic Energy:
$$ E=\frac{p^2}{2m}$$
E - is *Kinetic Energy*
