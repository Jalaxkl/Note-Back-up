# Velocity vs Time graph
- The increasing/ decreasing slope = **acceleration**
- The area under a graph = **displacement** 
- slope is 0 = constant velocity 
- Can be negative


# Displacement vs Time (Position vs Time)
- Slope = **Velocity** 
- Constant slope = constant **velocity** 
- Area under the graph = no real information 
- Quadratic slope = acceleration

# Acceleration vs Time Graphs 
- slope = Jerk (not sure what this is yet)
-  Area under the curve = Change in **Velocity**

# Linearizing graphs 
- Square the x axis
