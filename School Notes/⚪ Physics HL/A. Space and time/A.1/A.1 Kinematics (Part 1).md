# Overview

- that the motion of bodies through space and time can be described and analysed in terms of position, velocity, and acceleration
- velocity is the rate of change of position, and acceleration is the rate of change of velocity
- the change in position is the displacement
- the difference between distance and displacement
- the difference between instantaneous and average values of velocity, speed and acceleration, and how to determine them
- the equations of motion for solving problems with uniformly accelerated motion as given by

# Vector Vs Scalar graphs

## Vectors:
- Graphs can go negative cause you can have a negative direction 
- 
- *Examples*
	- Displacement 
	- Velocity 
	- Momentum 
	- Force

## Scalars 
- Do not usually have a *negative* slope and don't go below 0 
	- Motion cannot go negative if its scalar 
- **Temperature** is scalar and *can go negative* 

- *Examples*:
	- Mass 
	- Distance 
	- Speed 
	- Energy 
- Time
	- Power
- Current

# Distance vs Displacement 


## Distance (s)
*Definition*: The real **path length** the object follows 
*Simple words*: How far traveled in **total**
*Units*: (m)
Scalar
*Equation*: 


## Displacement (s)
*Definition*: is the Change in position 
*Simple words*: Distance from start to end
*Units*: Δx
Vector
*Equation*: $$ 
Δx = s= Xf-Xi
$$
Δx = Change in distance 
S= Unit for displacement 
Xf = Final position 
Xi = Initial starting point 

#### Displacement /time graphs 
- Slope = Velocity 
- Constant slope = constant velocity 
- Area under the graph = no real information

# Speed vs Velocity 

## Speed (v)
*Definition*: Rate of change of distance per unit of time 
*Simple words*: How fast
*Units*: ms^-1
Scalar and has **no direction**
*Equation*: $$ v = \frac {s (distance)}{t}
$$
v = Speed
s = distance
t = time

## Velocity (v)
*Definition*: Rate of change of displacement per unit time 
*Simple words*: How fast in any given direction 
*Units*: ms^-1
Vector: Must have a direction 
*Equation*: $$ v = \frac {s (displacement)}{t}
$$
v = Speed
s = Displacement 
t = time

#### Velocity /time graphs 
- The increasing/ decreasing slope = acceleration
- The area under a graph = displacement 
- slope is 0 = constant velocity 


## Acceleration 
*Definition*: Change in velocity as a function of change in time 
*Simple words*: change in velocity 
*Units*: ms^-2
Vector
*Equation*: $$ a=\frac{Δv}{t} = \frac{V-U}{t}$$ 
t = change in the time for the change in velocity 
Δv = change in velocity 
V= Final Velocity
U= Initial Velocity

# Average vs Instantaneous velocity 

## Average velocity  
*Definition*: The total displacement by the total time traveled 
*Equation*: $$ AvgVelocity= \frac{total}{Time}$$

## Instantaneous velocity  
*Definition*:The speed of velocity at one specific 'instant' in time. 
- Does not depend on any movement outside the instant 
*How to find*: Slope of graph on the point on a PvT graph shows the instant velocity.

# Free Fall 

## The downward pull of gravity 
*Definition*: Also known as acceleration due to gravity 

- Acceleration is ALWAYS 9.81ms^-2
	- Always points downward 
- If the object is dropped its initial velocity is 0ms^-1
- If an object is thrown upward its velocity at the highest point is 0ms^-1
