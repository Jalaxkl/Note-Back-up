# Work 

## Work Done (W)
*Definition*: 
*Simple words*: Must be a force (applied) * by the displacement of the object 
*Units*: **Joules** = Nm (Newton Meters) OR kg m^2 s^s 
*Equation*: $$
Work = Force*displacement = (W=F*S)
$$
- The Displacement must be a result of the force acting on the object 
- Work is Scalar:
	- Has a magnitude but *NO direction* 
- If there is a force perfectly perpendicular to an object its work will be 0 


# Energy 

## Kinetic Energy 
*Definition*: Any object in motion will have kinetic energy 
*Simple words*: Moving Object 
*Units*: Measured in Joules 
*Equation*: $$
Ek= \frac{1}{2} *m*v^2
$$
^ in terms of mass and velocity 

$$ Ek = \frac{p^{2}}{2m}
$$
^ In terms of momentum 



## Gravitational Potential Energy (GPE)
*Definition*: The amount of energy of attraction in relation between two objects with mass 
*Simple words*: Wo
*Units*: Joules 
*Equation*: $$ Ep= W*h ... GPE= m*G*h
$$
- Work done is equal to the amount of GPE 


## Elastic Potential Energy 
*Definition*: 
*Simple words*: 
*Units*: 
*Measured with:* 
*Equation*: 


# Energy conversion 

## Energy loss and conversion
*Definition*: Energy is never gained or destroyed, its only converted. 
*Simple words*: Energy moves around to different forms

**GPE = KE** 
- The Potential energy that is lost is always converted into Kinetic Energy
