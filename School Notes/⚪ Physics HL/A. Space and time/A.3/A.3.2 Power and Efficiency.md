- Energy transfer 
- Where energy goes 


## Power (W)
*Definition*: Is the rate at which **work** is done per unit time 
*Simple words*: "power is the rate at which **energy transformation** is done per unit time"
*Units*: Joules per seconds (Js^-1) = **Watts**
**Scalar**

*Equation*(s): $$
Power= \frac{Work}{ Time}=\frac{ConvertedEnergy}{Time}
$$
- **Below** is the main Equation for calculating power
$$
P=\frac{W}{t}= \frac{F*s}{t}
$$

- **Below** is the overall equation *(Simplified from above)*
$$
P=Fv 
$$


- Sometimes you will have work being done at *an angle* to an object 
- *In that case use this equation:* $$
P= \frac{F*cosθ*s}{t}
$$

# Efficiency 

## Efficiency
*Definition*: Efficiency is the ratio os useful output to total input expressed as a percentage. 
*Simple words*: How good something is as doing it
*Units*: Percentage (%)
*Measured with:* Sankey Diagrams 
*Equation*: $$
Efficiency= \frac{UsefulOutput}{TotalInput}*100
$$
