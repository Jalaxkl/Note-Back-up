###### The authors of these quotes both make assumptions about language.
*In Buddha's quote, he explores how the right language has the power to change people and situations. He suggests that people can use their language toÂ "bring peace"Â and positively influence someone's life.* *The quote implies, however, that people often provideÂ "a thousand hollow words"Â and thisÂ hyperboleÂ suggests that empty words are useless.* **The message seems to be that people should use fewer words and be more careful about the words they use.Â While Buddha encourages us to use few words, the second quote encourages us to learn more words.**Â *The Chinese proverb encourages us thatÂ "to learn a language"Â is to have one more "window" through which to view the world. TheÂ metaphorÂ compares languages to a house or perhaps even a castle and suggests that we have a better view of the world if we learn more than one language.* **The message is that languages offer a better understanding of cultures and therefore we can understand people and human nature more.Â Although both authors focus on different aspects of language, they are connected by their understanding that language has the power to develop empathy and an understanding of people and the world.**

What's in a name? 
knowing another language is to have a second meaning of the universe


The author of both quotes compare language to a persons identity. In Shakespeare's quotes, he explains that a name is only used to call someone and if you where to call anyone "by any other name" they would still be the same person. The quotes further shows how a name holds meaning to the identify when he asks "What's in a name?" This message written by Shakespeare gives an insight how a name is part of your identify, however if you were but another name you would still have that name be apart of your identity. A name has no definition and has no meaning but rather the meaning is held in the person's soul. Charlemagne further shows how the name and the identify of the soul in relation to another. He states that to know an another language you have a "second soul" from which you can view the world from. The message is that language can give insights and allow you to gain a better understanding of the cultures, and if used can allow you to view the world from a new lens. Knowing another language can be apart of your identify and is to have a second meaning of the universe.
