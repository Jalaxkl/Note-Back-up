# What have I learned about text? (Aug 2023)

Text is not just what you read in a book. It can also be what you see on an advert, or a sign. More importantly text can also be an object, like a water bottle or a pencil case. These objects have elements of text. (as above is noted) Paintings can also be seen as text. With their depictions and characters (or lack thereof) you can find the purpose, audience, and context of what is in the painting. The author of any text also helps with finding the context and can add to your content and elements.
