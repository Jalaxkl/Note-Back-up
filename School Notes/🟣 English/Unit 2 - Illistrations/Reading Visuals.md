# Analysis of 'Parents controlling their childâ€™s career path'

## Describe: First impressions:
- Parents controlling the Childs head (or path)
- Arrows on the bag all going different directions, showing the many paths possible 
- Words on the back such as: qualification, values, work, career and respect
- The depiction of a horse headgear on the child 
- Color contrast of the backpack and background create a chaotic feel (Two sides of color wheel)

## Respond: Gut Reaction and feel: 
- Upsetting that some children have to deal with this issue of their controlling parents. 
- Siri feels like she has seen this before...? 
	- Its easy to not see the 'brainwashing' effect that can occur 

## Analysis: What does it communicate
- By using the two contrasting colors found on the backpack and the background this biologically creates an extremely chaotic and unbalanced feel. (uneasiness)

- The horses head gear is gear that is used to control a horse, and in this case its being used to control the actions of a child to do and possibly follow in the parents footsteps. 

- The parents sitting on the backpack and should of the child can represent should angels. This is found when should angels create a conflict of opinion with two contrasting sides. This is represented also in the parents choice of color (red and white) further showing how the parents are feeding the child on what is correct and what is not.
