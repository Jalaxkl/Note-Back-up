My Individual Oral relates to the field of inquiry: Culture, identify and communities. 

Specifically, how families and memories of childhood cause a conflicting relationship between the parent a the Child. This can lead to the blaming of the parents for not allowing the children to grow up and become independent. Additionally, this would cause a conflict of perspectives from the experience of one child to parent

1. It has **significance** on a wide/large scale. 
2. It is **transnational**. 
3. Its **impact** is felt in everyday local contexts.

	Global issue first then attach poem 
	Less about analysis, focus on where you can find the global issue in your poem

# Introduction:

Tackling the global issue of child abuse and neglect is a hard as it affects more people than we realize. 

The poem We Remember your Childhood well By Carol Ann Duffy from the anthology "The other country" told from the **perspective** of the parent *discusses childhood relationship.*

This poem is a **monologue** of the parent who is talking to their child who is denying the pain they caused the child. Specifically, exploring the *communities of families* and how  

*memories of childhood cause a conflicting relationship* between the parent and the child. Through the beginning phrases of each stanza and the tone found while reading the poem focuses on diversity of experiences found in childhood that are held by both the parent and children. 
 

[Duffy illustrates the beginning stanzas to show the parents denial, furthermore how the parent and child have a conflict of perspectives and memories of the true events.] 


Throughout the poem its evident with phrases such as **"What does it matter now?"** (Line 16) and **"Nobody hurt you"** (Line 1) 

*This shows:* 
- The parent simply does not care about what they did to the child, and feels no remorse. 
- The parent is denying the pain they may have caused the child, and pushing it aside because it happened in the past. 

Further down the stanza it says **"We did what was best"** (Line 18)

*This shows:* 
- This further shows how even with the pain the parent caused it was disregarded and the effects were not considered. 
- Because of the adverse effects the child is unable to grow up independently. 


[Duffy using emphasis of tone to illustrate how the child disagree with the parent, this shows the independent thinking of the child and the diversity of perspectives.]

In the third stanza the speaker says **" The whole thing is inside your head"** 

*This shows:*
- How the parent is disregarding what the child is saying and only allowing for their point of view to be present 
- The parent 

At the very beginning of the 4th stanza it states **"What you recall are impressions; we have the facts.**

*This shows:*
- The child only knows the small tid bits they can remember. The parents apparently know it all 
- The parent is further showing their diversity because two parties now have two different lens and perspective of the same event. 

In conclusion: Duffy uses the emphasizes of tone and illustrates the denial of the speaker (or parents) in order to paint the idea that parents and child may not have the same opinion on the same outcome. In fact, its possible that the child disagrees with the parents decision. and this may cause a lack of conformity and cause friction between the parent and child. Nevertheless there are a miriade of diversity in experiences when it comes to parenthood and childhood. not everyone agrees.
