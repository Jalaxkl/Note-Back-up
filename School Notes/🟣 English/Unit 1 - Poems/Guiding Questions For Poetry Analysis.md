- The structure of a text, or in what way it is conveyed, can bring insights to how the author wants the text to be perceived. The structure like the ways the poem is written can highlight certain aspects of the content of the text, bringing to light what the author is trying to convey. Authors may use this to showcase the theme or overall tone of the poem. Additionally, different styles can lead to more interpretations of the text. This will allow the reader to get what they need out of the text. Adding transitions can block off certain parts of text leading to a more story like poem. While smoother transitions can lead to a more coherent flow in the poem.
