# Different kinds of theater 

## Avant garde theatre 

- term used to describe a type of theatrical performance that is characterized by its experimental and unconventional nature. Avant-garde theater emerged in the late 19th and early 20th centuries as a reaction to traditional theater, which was seen as formulaic and stale.

- Avant-garde theater often challenges conventional notions of storytelling, character development, and stagecraft. It may incorporate non-traditional elements such as multimedia, improvisation, and audience participation. The goal of avant-garde theater is often to disrupt the audience's expectations and to challenge them to think differently about the world around them.

- Some of the most famous avant-garde theater practitioners include Antonin Artaud, Samuel Beckett, and Bertolt Brecht. Avant-garde theater has had a profound influence on modern theater and continues to be an important and dynamic form of expression today.

- It's worth noting that avant-garde theater can be challenging and may not appeal to all audiences. However, for those who are open to new experiences and are willing to engage with unconventional forms of storytelling, avant-garde theater can be a powerful and thought-provoking experience
