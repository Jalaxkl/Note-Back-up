## Reflection:

### What needs improvment 

- Continually 
	- Slight differences in what I label things 'handmaids tale' vs handmaidens tale'
- Not enough focos on devices 
	- Too much focos on the context of what happens 
- Not describing what is relavant 
	- And how it is relevant 
- No mention or little mention of authors choices 
- Too much repetition of points (basically stop repeating yourself)
- More balance needed in the timings 


## Paper 1 
- When planning try to focous on what comes first cronologically in the paper
- Follow your thesis more and make sure its what truly is what the article is abour 
- The authors use of this.... shows how... (point)
- Why does this work as an opinion colume?
