# Non-violent Protests 
## Defiance Campaign .

- Designed to apply concentrated pressure on government 
	- Force it to get rid of apartheid 

- Achieved through the following methods:
	- ANC leaders would deliberately break the laws while onlookers joined in and helped 
		- Political potential of the masses 
	- non-violent civil disobedience 
		- Police would have to arrest thousands 
		- Large audience 
	- SA prisions would fill up and overflow 
		- Police and courts would be at a breaking point 
	- SAIC (Indian version of ANC) joined and helped the ANC 

- Reasons for the campaign:
	- Apartheid was clearly different than other forms of segregation 
		- Government utterly dismissed African opinion on any and all matters 
	- New Strategy needed
		- 1 day strikes would no longer cut it 
		- Needed longer sustained resistance 
	- ANC was losing relevance if it could not solve apartheid 

- Joint Action Committee 
	- Indian, colored, and even white political parties 
	- based around **Civil disobedience** 
	- NAC (National Action Committee) was created to organize the campaign
- The goal was to appeal 6 'unjust' laws 

- The Campaign peaked in August 1952 
	- 8300 volunteers had been arrested 

#### Was it a success?
- Nope in hindsight it was a failure 

- Did not meet politcal objectives 
- Not any 'unjust' laws were abolished 
- Apartheid government emerged stronger 
- Rural areas were hardly involved 
- Strikes never seemed to do much damage 
- Only middle class blacks could really participate (a smaller group than poor people)
- Very few colored joined in the Campaign 
- Overall was viewed by hostility especially by whites and viewed to be very radical

*However with its mistakes much was learned*
- ANC had its first coordinated national campaign against apartheid 
- Thousands of South Africans demonstrated readiness in the struggle 
	- The stage had been set for mass movement 
- A broad mix of people were a part of the movement 
- Profit for the ANC grew (more money for later)

## Freedom Charter

*The goal of the freedom charter was to:*
- Forge a singular front of South Africans 
- Expand ANC membership 
- Combine political goals of congress 
- Consolidate ANC strategy of working with other political parties

Who endorsed it:
- SAIC 
- South Africans colored peopls organization 
- South African communist party 
- SA congress of democrats 

*Convened as gatherings, conferences, and campaigns but mainly on a small scale*
**Mainly to raise awareness**
- Became an icon and attempt to end apartheid 

## Bus Boycotts 

*A large form of Black protest* 
- **1943** Nelson Mandela marched 9 miles from **1943** to Johannesburg with 10s of thousands of people 

- Usually a committee was formed to then negotiate with bus companies to not increase prices 
	- Price increase meant many could not afford daily bus driving. 
- Up to 20,000 people could protest fare increases and participate in bus boycotts at any given time

- Famous example: 
	- Alexandra Bus Boycotts 
		- **1957**- for 12 weeks 
		- fare was gonna be raised from 4 to 5 pence 
			- Worth about a months wage yearly 
			- 70,000+ workers walked 
			- Police regularly checked protestors 
	- Major threat from the apartheid government
