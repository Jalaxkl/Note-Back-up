# Idea of Apartheid 

## Context:
- Since the dawn of time people have had slaves and seen different races as superior 

- White boers viewed themselves as better cause the local black "hadn't done anything of value"
	- Thus put lower in the racial pile 

- Similar in regard to **social Darwinism** 
- Follow the route of **Calvinist**
	- The view that their places was god-given 

## Early practice:
- Practiced first in the Cape colony 
	- Two types of people: "Civilized" and "uncivilized"

*1901:*
- Racial segregation was officially introduced 
- Black only township

- The whites could easily exploit the black people as they were seen less than human. 
- Improvement was only gonna happen (supposedly) if they practiced segregation. 


## System of Segregation: (Some laws)

### South African Party (SAP)
- Stoped all blacks from voting
- Mines and work Act (*1911*) 
	- Reserved all skilled jobs in mines for whites 
- Natives land act *(1913)* 
	- Prohibited blacks from owning land 
- Later: The Natives (Urban areas) land act *(1923)*
	- Any black person in a city must be carrying a pass 

### Smuts and Herzog
- United party took office in 1934
- Native laws amendment (*1937*)
	- Stricter enforcement of pass laws

- During this time Boer nationalism fell 
	- Parades where organized
	- poorer afrikaners wanted MORE restrictions 

*1946*:
- Africans miners Union organized a protest 
	- 9 killed 
	- Brought the government's attention
