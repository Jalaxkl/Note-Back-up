# Sharpeville massacre - 21 March 1960

## Intent 
- To peacefully protest the Pass Book laws 
- To start civil disobedience meeting in a field. 
	- Move to the police station 
		- Saying "arrest me I don't have my pass book"
		- And then they would have to let everyone go cause not enough space for everyone in the jail 

## Effect - Start of armed struggle 

- Sharpeville marked a turning point in the history of the ANC to a more armed struggle
	- It was clear that the apartheid government could not be reasoned with. 

- ANC was banned and had to go underground 
	- Could no longer negotiate with the Apartheid government 

- PAC and ANC become rivals 
	- PAC had a armed wing ready 
	- ANC did not and was at risk 
		- Wanted more guerrilla warfare than all out war. 


## wider significance 

- International isolation of southern Africa 
- diplomatic setback from British commonwealth 

## Rivonia Trial 

**1963 - 1964**

	- MK tried running the show without him 

- Police raided the *Liliesleaf Farm* a 'safe house'
	- Found documents and put more ACN members on trial for treason and inciting strikes 
		- Found guilty and sentenced to life in prison (not death penalty)
