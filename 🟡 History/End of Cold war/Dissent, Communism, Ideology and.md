# Questions

## Is political oppression part of the communism ideology?

***For: (Yes)***
- There is too many people with different ideas: Communism cannot consolidate all of them equally 
	- Cannot implement everyones ideas 
- Only one political party 


***Against (no)***
- Gorbechove (and other leaders) were willing to liberalize the economy and give people more freedom of speech and though this implied that they did not see a conflict between those and communism. Communism at its core is supposed to be based on the equity of the masses?


### Claim?

The ideological challenges imposed by the implementation of communism made political oppression a byproduct of governmental policies and by effect liberalizing the market cauing the fall of the Soviet Union.
