## Nature of Discrimination
- National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) led legal fights to give colored rights 

-  Most colored people stayed in the south where most of the rasicm happened

- Were subject to peonage or debt slavery 
	- Working on land that was owned and they paid what they could back to the land owner making a small profit in the middle 

- Race riots: 
	- Electoral party of Democrats needed to win to keep the 'slavery' in place 
	- as the town was majority african american many people were concerned they would vote republican 
		- Shots heard and more lynchings made it to so republicans did not win 
	- concern of rape 'i say we should lynch 1000 negros a week' to stop the concern
	- **Tulsa race riots:**
		- considered the worst bit of racial violence in american history 
		- 50-300 colored people killed 
		- 1000 homes destroyed

- WW2
	- Despite african americans helping in the war segregation continued

Jim crow laws remained in effect until 1954


## Character of Discrimination 

- Black people were arrested for minor violations that would normally have been a fine

- Arrested colored worked off the debt they incurred as they were imprisoned 
- Forced to work in subliving conditions with little or no pay 
- Essentially slaves (again)

- lynchings were commonplace for alleged crimes 
	- White mobs 
	- KK (Klu Klux Clan)
		- Originated in Tennesse but grew to the entire south 
		- Brought fear of violence to most of everyone in the south 
		- 1925 KKK had 4 millions members

- The slaves body did not belong to the individual but the owner of the individual

- Everything was done to stop african americans from winning office
	- Not counting votes for africans
	- Ballot stuffing 
	- fear and intimidation 
	- Democrats did not allow africans to join the party

## Classroom 

- The song by Billie Holiday
	- What was it like for the black people when it came to the lynching of their own race? What would this make them feel?
	- To what extent did the local population know about the issues of lynchings?


- Biggest difference between apartheid and US civil rights?

Connecting the US and SA civil rights and apartheid 
- The US was a lot more violent in terms of outright homicides and lynching by the citizens, SA murder was done by officials  
- SA was a lot more big on trying to peacefully get rid of apartheid 
- SA had much more uniform laws against black people, US was dependent on state  
- SA had classifications of color, US it was either white or black 
- SA + US had people of color use separate amenities 
- SA + US both had riots and then genocides of people of color


Connecting Jim Crow laws to apartheid:
- They both had laws against people of color 
- Jim crow was mainly the south while apartheid was everyone 
- Apartheid was governement mandate vs Jim crow laws was state laws
