# Segregation and education 

- Changed the legal landscape for segregation including in public 

- Paradigm shift:
	- 'African bill of rights'

- Shift happened over a lot of time with leadership from the NAACP 
	- Charles Mailiton Houston being a major spearhead 
		- 'man who kill Jim Crow' 

" If we boldly challenge the constitutional validity of segregation if and when accompanied irremediable by the discrimination we can strike directly at the most prolific sources of discrimination. "
-NACCP (1930)

- NACCP challenged the 'equal' statment in 'seperate but equal'
	- White students reived 3-5x as much in money per student compared to african students 
		- Started at higher education insitiutions to not upset large populations or have large economic impacts 
			- One client had no ability to get into a african law school as not a single one existed so they forced a white school to let him in 

- NAACP tried in many areas to create equal areas for both africans and whites 
	- Gaines vs Missouri (1938)
		- School was ordered to admit gaines and give him equal but seperate spaces for teaching 
	- Sweatt vs Painter and Mclaurin V oklahoma state regents 
		- It was evident that no laws school was truly equal for africans 
		- separate could not ever be equal and this was becoming apparent to the supreme court 

- 1953 
	- Dwight D eisenhower appointed two new supreme court justices 
		- One was very pro-civil rights for all 
			- (many did not like him)
		- Last stepping stone for Brown vs Board 

- May 1954 
	- Supreme court ruled that any segregation in publics schools was inherently unequal and 
		- Many mixed reaction 
			- Some loved the Jim crow laws 
			- Other found it liberating to not be oppressing one race entirely 
		- Still lots of work to ACTUALLY desegregate schools 
			- Many districts got creative to make it nigh impossible for a student to get admitted due to the amount of logal comlications and paperwork 
				- They were still allowed but not admitted
