- Continued to find a way to assassinate castro (CIA)

- President Kennedy's Prestige increased enormously 
- Weakened Khrushchev's influence 

### Soviet decision to place missle in Cuba 1962
- Key reasons for doing so:
	- Gain a way to threaten the US 
	- Correct a strategic imbalance with NATO being so close to Russia 
	- Defend the communist Cuban government 

- August 1962 is when the treaty was signed 
- By october 4th 158 missiles sites were operational 

## Long Term Cause

- Missiles are removed from Turkey

# Height of the crisis 

- 14th of October a U2 Spy plane discovered the missiles sites 

## Quarintine zone 

- The US navy established a quarantine zone 1300 kilometers from Cuba's coast 
	- Russia ships would be searched to verify there were no weapons aboard 

- Khrushchev told Russian ships to challenge a blockade, increasing the chances of a Naval conflict 

## Soviet decision to withdraw missles 
- In the United Nations Committee 
	- USSR would with-draw missiles from cuba 
	- USA would not attack cuba 

- USA was on the highest alert level ever, ready to strike at any moment if cuba had made the decision of firing missiles 

- USA was told to withdraw NATO missiles from turkey so Russia would not be threatened (This was done secretly and not known to the public right away)

# Response of China 

- It seems that China saw the Cuban missiles crisis as a way to test ths USSR of its devotion to communism 
	- When the USSR pulled missiles out of cuba this lower relationships 
	- View as treacherous to Mao "Soviet Communist Revisionism‚Äù and ‚ÄúRightist Capitulationism.‚Äù"
		- USSR pulled forces out of China 

Essentially China did not want peaceful existence but also didn't want to be destroyed by nukes, so they tried to play the side of being annoying as possible 

The Cuban missiles crisis increased tensions with the USSR and China making them more likely to start bombing each other rather than the USA and other communist nations
