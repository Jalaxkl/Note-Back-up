# Causes 

### Comparing to vietnam war 

- Both wars involved foreign powers 



- **Vietnam was fought for the preservation of US control over South Vietnam**
- **Afghan was fought for the preservation of Soviet control over Afghanistan**


### Contrasting to vietnam war 

- Afgan war was based on religion 

- Vietnam people wanted communism 

- Vietnam had US troops land, afgan did not. 

- US expanded the war into other countries outside of vietnam 

Vietnam was to contain communism, Afghanistan was to expand socialism to communism and try to stabilize them
