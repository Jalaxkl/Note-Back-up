Malcolm X and Nelson Mandela were influential leaders in their respective struggles for racial equality, though their approaches varied significantly. Both were associated with controversial organizations: Mandela with the African National Congress (ANC), labeled a terrorist group by South African and U.S. authorities, and Malcolm X with the Nation of Islam (NOI), often criticized for promoting bigotry. Their speeches were powerful tools to mobilize support, with Malcolm Xâ€™s public speaking skills honed as the NOIâ€™s representative, while Mandelaâ€™s speeches, including his statement during his imprisonment, inspired hope against Apartheid. Despite their shared commitment to racial justice, they diverged in tactics and beliefs. Malcolm X endorsed Black nationalism, self-determination, and even violence if necessary, criticizing integration as a potential threat to Black autonomy. Conversely, Mandela, though initially aligned with nonviolent methods inspired by Gandhi, welcomed White support and emphasized unity, even tolerating civil disobedience when peaceful protests failed. While Malcolm Xâ€™s approach was rooted in religious motivation from Islam, Mandela, a Christian, refrained from infusing his faith into his activism, focusing instead on a broad-based, inclusive movement.
