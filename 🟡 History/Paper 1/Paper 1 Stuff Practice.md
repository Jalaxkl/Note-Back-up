###### What does Source A suggest about the events that unfolded at Little Rock Central High School in 1957?
1. The brown vs. Board has finally come into effect in Arkansas and Little Rock High School; this can be seen with colored people who are entering what was originally an all-white school. 

2. The transition to desegregation from segregated school was a trouble in Arkansas; this is shown by the presence of federal and National Guard troops escorting the children of color into the school. The amount of federal troops show how dangerous the situation was. 


###### With reference to the origin, purpose and content of Source B, analyse the value and limitations of this source for historians studying the public response to events at Little Rock.

A value to the public reaction of Little Rock comes from its origin. It's clear that Senator Russell from Georgia, who is very high ranking, has strong opposing opinions and that Eisenhower is 'applying tactics which must have been copied from... Hitler's stormtroopers." It shows how strongly opposed some people were to the desegregation of races. 

A value to the public reaction found in Source B is in regard to the purpose. It is clear that the senator wrote this telegram as a reaction to Little Rock, being strongly opposed, this would show the significant negative emotional response that the public had 

A limitation of these sources when studying public reaction comes from the content. The senator strongly believes the army is 'overriding the elementary rights of Americans' and that the military is there to intimidate. From past knowledge we know this is not true and was used to escort the children of color, this is a limitation of content because someone studying would need additional knowledge to fully understand the use of the military at Little rock.


###### Compare and contrast Sources B and C for what they reveal about the public response to events at Little Rock.

Comparing the two sources, a commonality is the strong opposition to desegregation. Its clear that "I must vigorously protest" and "white people to live as they wish" show how both sources agree that whites should stay separate from blacks and that forcing of racing mixing should not be allowed. 

A contrast between the two sources is the nature of an appeal. In source B it is saying how unjust and terrible the military is acting. On the contrary Source C says instead of letting the government decide we should vote. This clear difference shows how some people clearly want to change while others would be open to change with a vote. 

A contrast between the two sources is the mention of Little Rock. Source B mentions the events at Little Rock and this appears to be the main reason for the telegram while Source C has no mention. Rather, this just wants desegregation as a whole to not continue in its entirety. 

A commonality between the two sources is the how they feel they are being forced. Source B mentions "Mixing the races by force" and in Source C "force this mixing of races on us". From both sources its clear that the public feels forced to desegregate and interact with people of color.


# Things to Remember

- When in purpose, ONLY talk about value OR limitation, not both as they will contradict each other. Choose one that you are most confident in 

- OPCVL is Relevance or reliability 

- Clearly state if its a comparison 

- Clarity is important 
	- You can embed quotes 
	- Only need 3 words per side 1,2,3....1,2,3

- Leave space between segments 

- Restate the prompt because it help YOU stay focused 

## Common Mistakes 

- Not a clear thesis with points lead to an essay that is highly narrative 

- Do not start your paragraph with 'this claim is supported by'

- having a clear topic sentence makes your paragraph flow better

- Make into actual paragraph format

- Having a clear plan and structure before you begin the essay

- Multiple sources per paragraph
