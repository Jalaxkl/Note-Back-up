# Question 1
**Consider carefully, and then state below in the space provided why you wish to enroll in the Army ROTC Program.  Indicate in your statement how you believe your own objectives in life are related to the education and training offered by Army ROTC and what a career obligation means to you. (2000)**

Army ROTC trains and develops the future leaders of the US Army. Joining the program will allow me to expand my self-confidence in leadership. This is why I wish to join the Army ROTC program. The classes and training I will receive will allow me to expand on my current skills. I am a reasonably good natural leader; I can confidently command a room and delegate tasks effectively. I learned this by completing the Eagle rank, with positions such as Senior Patrol Leader. Leadership in scouting taught me skills to plan, prepare, and carry out successful activities. Also, I have had various leadership roles, including track, rugby, and robotics team captain. These roles have taught me to manage group expectations and goals. Being a church leader has only added to both of these. Each year, I have learned new ways to apply my leadership abilities. Joining Army ROTC will be the next step in my leadership journey. The education offered by the ROTC program will teach me skills I already highly enjoy. These include survival skills and being active outdoors. I regularly do these activities for fun with my father, a past ROTC graduate. These lessons will be highly enjoyable, and I will continue to be active and adventurous because of the increased self-confidence and discipline gained through the ROTC program. Not only will I be able to apply them in my current active lifestyle, but they will also carry into my future career as an officer in the army. The skills I can gain from the ROTC program will progress my future career, gaining higher value because of my leadership experience as an Army Officer. All my leadership abilities and skills will allow me to fulfill any job asked of me because I will gain the confidence necessary. To me, a career obligation means doing everything asked of me to the best of my ability. Whether it will be learning necessary new skills or challenging current skills, together, ROTC will progress my career and allow me to gain new leadership skills. 


# Question 2
**State below in the space provided how you spend your time in a typical week during the school year.  For Example, how many extra hours do you spend: at school, doing homework, engaged in athletic activities, engaged in extracurricular activities (i.e. clubs), engaged in volunteer work, or other (explain). (2000)**


In a typical week during the school year, I manage time between academics, sports, CCA's (Co-Curricular activities), and some personal interests. Before school starts, I take an early morning Seminary Class as part of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints. Here, I am taught how to be a better disciple of Jesus Christ and resist the world's temptations. The most significant portion of any given day of the week starts with school. School regularly runs from 7:40 to 15:00, around 7 hours a day.  After the conclusion of school, I will have an after-school activity. All after-school activities run from 15:00-17:00. I always participate in a sport: track, rugby, and soccer are what I frequent. These activities happen 4 times a week, Monday, Wednesday, Friday and Saturday. On Thursdays, I frequent the STEM lab for robotics. My primary role as the team captain in this club is to pilot the building stage. To a large extent, my designs have become the basis of our strategy. On Tuesdays, I participate in 1:20 min of service throughout the day. 20 minutes at the beginning of the day and an hour after classes. I help lead the service group at our school to aid a local animal shelter, however possible. Each day, I get home around 18:00 for dinner. This means that around 19:00, I start the 2ish hours of homework and studying each night. Occasionally, I will have a tutor when necessary, and that will happen during these two hours, which is included in studying time. Promptly after studying, I will go to bed to maintain a healthy 8-hour sleep schedule. Saturdays are more relaxing, giving me time in the afternoon to work on personal projects. Currently, I am working to restore a 1970 VW beetle, going as far as replacing the floor pans and all the weather seals. I finish off the week with Church on Sunday and a final day of rest, or in reality, a day for extra studying and homework. Overall, my schedule in a typical week is crazy but remains simple in its repetition. 





# Additional remarks

**Please expand on any additional information outlining scholastic, athletic and leadership achievements not otherwise annotated in the previous sections.  Although you are not required to do so, you are highly encouraged to do so if applicable. (2000)**


Some things not previously noted: 

I am living abroad with my parents, who work with the Department of State here in Pretoria, South Africa. Our previous post was in Taipei, Taiwan. This explains my two different transcripts and the slight difference in activities I was able to participate in. We moved between my 9th and 10th year of high school. 

During 9th grade, I participated in scouting and received my Eagle Scout rank. Unfortunately, BSA does not exist in South Africa, so I was unable to continue the activity.

I interned at the embassy during the summer school breaks. This occurred after my 10th and 11th grade years. 

Because of my international lifestyle, I am taking IB (International Baccalaureate) classes. This causes some trouble as my classes are graded on a 1-7 grading scale. Which does not transfer well to a 4.0 GPA grading scale. My school provides a transfer scale. This is only somewhat helpful because the grading scale for IB changes year to year, meaning that the scale provided does not fully represent my abilities as a student. Additionally, IB and AP level courses have different material and teaching methods.
