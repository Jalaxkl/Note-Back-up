# Instructions 
Input your high school extracurricular activities on the **Activities** tab. Complete this section as thoroughly as possible. This section is divided into two parts – Athletic Activities and Scholar/Leader Activities.

                 a.  If your sport is not listed in the drop-down menu, select “Other” and identify what the other activity is in the Additional Remarks section on the Essays tab.

                 b.  If you participate in travel sports such as travel soccer or AAU basketball, indicate this by checking the “Jr Varsity, Legion, etc.” box. If the box is used already, because you also played the sport at the JV-level in high school, use the “City or County Organized Leagues” box. Also identify the league and level  in the Additional Remarks section on the Essays tab.

                 c.  It is vitally important to you to indicate all extra-curricular activities in which you participated. If the Activities tab doesn’t give you sufficient options for the activities you have been associated with, complete the section to the best of your abilities. Also, upload a resume to the File Upload tab which highlights those activities.

                 d.  While you may not have started your senior year, include the activities you will participate in for that year. If you played at the varsity level during previous years, indicate varsity level for the senior year as well.

                 e.  To edit a sport you have already listed, you must delete that sport entirely and re-enter the old data as well as the new.
