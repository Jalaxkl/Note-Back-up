Rugby; a contact sport where your only protection is a mouthguard. My role coordinates the forwards and backs in scrums and on-field plays. I started as the winger and upgraded to the starting scrum-half. In practice, I am frequently the test dummy to teach younger and new additions to the team.

In all honesty, I was initially peer-pressured to join the school's rugby team. I was living in Taiwan at the time. All the young men in my quorum had joined, and having major FOMO, I also joined. Initially, I was skeptical; I had never watched a game or knew the rules, except that a player passed the ball backward and ran forward..? (My only explanation of the game at that time was courtesy of my fellow youth.) It was not a great start, but slowly, I advanced from novice to starting winger that season. I made every mistake in the book. I remember running on the line (counting as out) and missing 7 points for my team. However, I had to keep persevering. When my family moved to South Africa, the best country for rugby, my skills were tested again. Not only do they play a slightly different version of rugby at my school: rugby 7s. The people I was playing against were quite literally twice my size. Taking my skills from Taiwan and adding to them with the help of my coach and friends, I learned all that I needed to become the starting scrum half. It is a huge responsibility to be in charge of players' positions in the heat of the game and call out plays simultaneously. Rugby has taught me many physical skills that helped enhance my performance but also skills applicable to everyday life. Perseverance and not being a quitter. Not every rugby practice was enjoyable, but the journey and pain were worth it. Rugby has continually taught me that joy can come from pain and hardships.

Robotics is an intellectual activity in which I have played some part in all roles. In middle school, until 9th grade, I was the dedicated driver of the robot in competition. Later, after moving schools, I realized my building potential and became our robotics team's captain and leading builder.

Reflecting on the past, I joined Robotics as it was the easiest way to enter a STEM-related club. I strive to eventually become an engineer with the express purpose of designing and building cool things and solving complex problems. Robotics hit all of these boxes for me. I joined as a driver cause I had no clue how to do anything. At least I had excellent MarioKart skills from my childhood. Outside of driving, in a few years, I started communicating with the team about my design idea and implementing it to make our lives easier and more efficient. Occasionally, I would dabble in the coding side of controls to make my driving more manageable. As we moved to South Africa, I learned about my ability to visualize designs in my head and bring them to fruition. Because of this newfound skill, I could design solutions for our now autonomous robots and make them as efficient as possible. Driving was no longer a position, so I switched to building and gained more engineering skills. From this experience, I quickly had to learn problem-solving skills. My designs rarely worked the first time or even possibly the second. New problems would present themselves, and you would restart the process. It's challenging to constantly be in review, only seeing progress once it all comes together. Robotics taught me the basics of how to be an engineer, how to solve problems and lots of skills in design. I plan to use these skills in further education and careers to expand my abilities.
