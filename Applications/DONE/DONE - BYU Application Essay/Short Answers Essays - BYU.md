##### Describe a topic, idea, or experience that you find so engaging that it makes you lose all track of time. What have you done to learn more or engage further in the topic, idea or experience? What resources do you use to learn more? (1500) (Approved)

Controlled explosions in series, or better yet, engines. I am passionate about anything with a motor that goes VROOM, from planes to cars to boats. In particular, the topic of cars caught my interest because of their high complexity and exciting designs. Unfortunately, Car YouTube videos entertain me for a long time. So, I designed a plan to engage further: a project car. In South Africa, Volkswagen manufactured beetles. There are many models in various states of operation. After my parents agreed to get a project car, we picked up a 1970 VW Beetle in a pastel baby blue color in need of a makeover. Straight away, we started rust removal on the side panels and interior, replaced the floor pans, and did some repainting. The project is ongoing, but we plan to make a custom interior with a custom headliner and seats. Instead of buying all the materials to install, I challenged myself to see if I could create all the pieces we wanted. To learn more about VW Beetles in general, online resources have greatly helped, but VW auto shop experts have helped me even more. I was privileged to discuss my project with the experts and ask their opinions. Because of their long history, they've seen it all, and their expertise has guided me and stopped me from making terrible mistakes. Every day, there is some new challenge with the project, but learning these practical trades will teach me many skills in the long term for my future career goals and aspirations.

##### Have you become aware of significant needs in your family, school, and/or community? Please explain how you have worked toward meeting those needs. (1500)


Every day on the bus to school, I pass one of the worst slums in the city: Diepsloot. It is a humble community and not safe to enter. The contrast between their poverty and the affluent students on the bus is striking. As a school, we have service built directly into the curriculum to give back to the community of Diepsloot and Johannesburg. As members of a financially stable private school, we can quickly and readily help those in need. Our service groups have had collaborative musical performances, training computer literacy, and working with animal shelters. However, as my time at AISJ continued, I noticed students needed to be more understanding of the point of service and were trying to avoid it. In other words, students only did it because it checked a box for graduation. What was missing was their connection to the service and the impact they could have on their community. This last year, I saw the need to rekindle the flame of service learning (SL) at our school. The best way to fulfill this need was to join the council overseeing SL at school to bring back some enthusiasm. One initiative I joined the council in was to have more engaging assemblies. Usually, they would be monotonous and boring, killing the excitement. Being more positive about SL at my school will help things get done more successfully and be more beneficial to the people in our community who are less fortunate. Giving back to them will also, in return, give back to us through the joy it will bring.

##### Briefly describe a time that your efforts have fallen short, a goal was not accomplished, or an aspiration was not achieved. (500)

Clearly, the food drive needed to be fixed. As part of my service group in 10th grade, we were highly embarrassed by our efforts. Not only did we get nearly zero donations, but all the donations were from members of our group. No other students donated. As our final project for the year, we wanted to give the shelter extra food. We volunteered to provide food for hundreds of dogs, cats, and even the occasional horse. Our goal was at least a carload, but that goal was far from being achieved.


###### What steps did you take to recover from this defeat? What resources did you use? How and why are you different today? (1500)

Clearly, our efforts seemed futile. It was the end of the year, and there was no time to do another. So, we settled for trying again the following year but using what we learned from our mistakes. Reflecting on our defeat, we realized everything we did was too passive. Our advertisement included posting a section in the weekly school newsletter and a few flyers around campus. Because of our previous failures, this time we decided to ask for continual donations throughout the year instead of a fixed time frame. New resources we utilized were participating in fairs our school put on that allowed our community to come together. In tandem with our shelter, Woodrock, we used a pavilion for people to learn more about Woodrock. This would help to garner more attention and receive donations at a later time. Also, we encouraged pet owners to donate extra food they had instead of going out to purchase new products. This was a lot more successful in gaining donations from our school community. We improved drastically at the end of the year, getting more donations than the previous year. Also, our efforts taught us that a student heard about the shelter and adopted a dog for their family. One defeat should not stop you from giving back, as it is the best form of joy in the world. My group's efforts showed how, if you put in enough effort, you can give back to your community in small but meaningful ways.

##### Tell us your story. What will you contribute to our university community? Be specific. (1500)

As an international student, I have been privileged to experience the different diversity of countries I have lived in, the cultures I have engaged with, and the challenges associated with moving around the world. With my lifestyle, I have spent the majority of my life living abroad in Africa, East Asia, and Europe. In each country, I attended schools in which students hail from all corners of the planet. This has given me a great appreciation for diverse perspectives and the ability to bridge gaps between cultures and languages. What I can bring to BYU is an international mindset. I can see the world through one cultural lens and as an interconnected whole. I am comfortable navigating differences in language, traditions, or opinions. I have learned to create bridges and unity even in a diverse atmosphere. This skill is applied daily to group projects, discussions, and after-school activities. Additionally, I am highly passionate about collaboration, particularly in teams where sharing ideas is enriched through varied perspectives. I have seen firsthand how diverse thinking can lead to creative solutions and innovative ideas. I wish to contribute my varied perspectives on creativity and innovation to BYU. In short, I will bring an international outlook to BYU with a readiness to connect with people from all walks of life who also have a passion for learning. These qualities will contribute positively to BYU's culture and perspectives while enhancing my own knowledge.

##### A BYU education will be spiritually strengthening. BYU students have a unique opportunity to seek learning by study and by faith. Describe the reasons you want to learn in an environment like this. (1500)

A vast portion of my ability to retain the values and covenants I have made has been thanks to a large part being sheltered in a small private school and loving family. Being a member, I will retain some of this ability to resist the world's temptations, but it will not be nearly enough. With the constant spirit of the Holy Ghost and daily remembrance of Christ, remaining Christ-centered will be easier in today's world. As one of its core values, BYU will give me a more direct and constant reminder of the necessity of having Christ at the center of my life. Additionally, because like-minded students will be on campus, my transition will be easier and more resistant to worldly comforts. Leaving my sheltered bubble, becoming an adult, and finding myself will become difficult; BYU will benefit me. Additionally, I wish to study in the environment of BYU because I can apply the scriptures to my study. For example, I can do projects in school that revolve around scripture, doctrine, or stories. Currently, I am unable to do this. This is highly valuable to me, as it's easy to separate the two subjects of school and gospel learning with a line of relevancy. School seems more relevant and important, separating it from gospel learning. However, this line will disappear because of BYU's unique environment, allowing me to explore gospel learning alongside my studies. Learning at BYU will make my studies and adult life more enjoyable.
