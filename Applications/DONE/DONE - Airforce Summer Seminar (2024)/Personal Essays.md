"Come on, Jed, it's time; the movers are here; we just got word last night that we are moving to South Africa now," as I slowly animate myself out of bed, grumbling, "Great." This would be the eighth new school that we are heading to. This would be different from the rest. Our assignment had changed on the second day of moving out, which meant we were pretty much going blind; months of preparation were now gone. I knew very little about this new school and even less about the people in it.

With the flight times and arrivals, I would even have to forgo student orientation, arriving at the school without knowing where to start. A few months later, after our visit to the States had concluded and we tried to visit all corners of the States, we finally headed to the airport for our first 10+ hour flight. This time, we would be in the air for 14 hours straight. Upon arriving, nothing caught my eye besides it being super cold. I regretted that the sweater was buried in the bottom of my suitcase; it hadn't been like this before we left. This would be a very interesting country. Arriving at school just two days later, I was immediately confused. My sister had disappeared, and I had no clue where to go for my Homeroom class to start the year. My new school was relatively large, with many people who looked very different from my last post. This would be an interesting country. 

The hardest part about my family's lifestyle, with the constant moving, is the uncertainty it brings. Uncertainty not just about where to get groceries for food or where our house is (because rarely did we move into a home straight away, having to live in a guest house for the beginning months of our post) but also who you would meet, people are by far the most complex and most common uncertainty, no one wants to befriend someone they might end up disagreeing with later. Finding your friend every time you move to a new school is always a challenge, but this year it was more challenging than the others. I moved from friend group to friend group for months before finally finding the right people about six months in. This certainly was a challenge because friends are how you learn about the country you are in. They can tell you where to go, what fun to do, and, just as importantly, where the good restaurants are. 

After a year of being in South Africa, the struggle of moving here immensely helped me become a more friendly and social person. Humans are naturally social creatures, and if we lose the ability to make friends, we can lose part of what being human feels like. Because I was jumping around to new people, I introduced myself to many people in my school (some more savory than others). From this experience, I could re-learn much of what it meant to be social after the lockdowns from the COVID-19 Virus, thus changing me into a friendly and approachable person.

# 2. What makes you a unique candidate for the summer seminar program? (1500 characters max)

From the average American teenager, my life has been far from ordinary. Living half of my life in the States and the other half overseas. Since my dad started working for the Department of State, I have lived in 5 countries: the USA, Mauritania, Finland, Taiwan, and South Africa. I regularly visit my family who live in the States between posts; however, much of my personality comes from other cultures outside my homeland. To a point where even my vocabulary usage has changed to be a mix of the East Coast and outside influences; occasionally, my siblings and I will even have small conversations in foreign dialects picked up throughout the years. From my experience overseas, I have gained a 3-year proficiency in Mandarin Chinese. I am currently taking Spanish classes at my current school. Being around different people, even those that don't speak English and of other cultures opens up how you view the world. I no longer see the world just from the "American" perspective. However, with each new country I visited, I got closer and closer to a "Global" perspective. From this, I have learned that the "American" way may not always be the best way, and there can be many solutions to one problem. Due to my unique and more globalized perspective, I can view the world from a unique lens devoid of just one nationality but rather a mix, allowing me to solve problems that may be on my path uniquely.
