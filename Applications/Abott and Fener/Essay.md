## From Lyons Essay

What are your personal goals for obtaining a Private Pilots License? (300)


To fly among the stars with the beasts of the sky. As a young child, I was hooked on the movie How to Train Your Dragon, and every time, I fell in love with the scenes depicting the main character, Hiccup, flying among the clouds. I have always wanted to be just like Hiccup to fly anywhere and see the planet from its world within a world. 

Exploration is why I have always dreamed of getting a Pilot's License since I was a young child. Not only to have freedom of movement but also to explore our planet from above. As I am now older, my two main reasons for wanting a PPL stem from the exploration aspects that flying gives you, such as seeing places not visible from the ground and getting to hard-to-reach areas. 

I am fascinated by experimental bush planes, with their short takeoff and landing distances and landing in the remotest places on Earth. Because of this, my favorite plane became the Bushliner 1850EX, an aircraft with a 1000NM range carrying 1700lb of cargo! The best part is that it can do all of that while going 150 knots. A true marvel of engineering that, one day, I aspire to fly. 

When I get my PPL, this is the path I want to follow: to explore our planet from a new perspective and go places few have been or even dreamed of seeing. The power of flight will help me achieve my childhood dream of feeling like Hiccup as he rides around on a dragon. However, instead of flesh and bones, I will have the engine, wings, and motivation to explore our planet to its entirety.  


2) Describe your goals. What do you aim to achieve in the near and long term. Where do you se yourself in 5 years? (500 words)


Our planet has three worlds: the ocean, land, and sky; no other place gives you the same sense of power as being able to explore the sky kingdom on Earth. But to get there, I first need a Pilot's License. 

Shortly after graduating High school in May of 2025, I plan on attending a flight training center here in South Africa, where I am currently living. South Africa is well known for producing good pilots, and many people in Africa and parts of Asia come to South Africa to get their PPL. 

I have been looking at Blue Chip Flight School based in Pretoria or FliteCare based in Wonderboom; both offer very well-renowned education for PPLs. The goal would be to work on getting my PPL during the June-July season before I head off to university in August. 

My goal for June is to complete all the necessary examinations and gain knowledge before I start flying. Additionally, I plan to begin the required flying hours for a PPL near the end of June. This way, during July, I can solely focus on my flying skills, from getting the perfect landing to learning navigational skills. 

Once this time finishes and I receive my private pilot license, I will attend Utah Valley University during fall of 2025 and take their professional pilot program, with a minor in aviation science. Studying at UVU's aviation facilities is unique because UVU has FAA approval to endorse the R-ATP Certificate at 1,000 hours rather than your regular 1,500 hours of flight time. 

Reducing the time required to get into a regional airline allows me more time to work on my seniority. The program at UVU takes you from start to finish to getting your Commercial Pilots License. This is my end goal: within the next 5 years, I will have my CPL and look for opportunities to get the required hours to get into the airlines. 

Thinking more long term, after getting my CPL, I have been researching a few opportunities to gain hours and experience in the aviation field. One option I have dreamed about is working for the RedTail aviation company; they do sightseeing tours in Moab, Utah. Working for RedTail aligns with my motivation to get my PPL and to see and explore the world from new perspectives. 

Aerial tours give the best office views, and working for something I enjoy will motivate and help me keep my dream alive. In the far future, I am unsure where my path will lead me after working for the regional airlines. However, I am considering working for a major international airline such as Delta, Airfrance, or KLM. Regardless, the very end goal is to work for a major international airline. Joining an international airline will lead me to a fulfilling, motivating, enjoyable job every day. The airline industry is very fascinating to me, and with my graduation coming ever closer, I can't wait to be able to fly.
