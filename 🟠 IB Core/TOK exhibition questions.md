## Final question - What is the answer?

30. What role does imagination play in producing knowledge around the world? 

**What is imagination?**

**Defintion**:
"the act or power of forming a mental image of something not present to the senses or never before wholly perceived in reality" 
"Creation in the mind"
"Fanciful or empty assumption"

**My definition:**
Imagination is the ability of a person to produce new ideas and thoughts about something not currently present or otherwise. Additionally its the ability to reflect on the past of ones actions

Imagination plays a role at producing new ideas, helping people further development in themselves and lives as well as in the material world. Imagination is the basis of new ideas and thus new knowledge 

TOK concepts that could be used
- Interpretation 
- Explanation 
- Perspective
