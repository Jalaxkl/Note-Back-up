**Commentary for object 1:**

Above is an image of the 3D printer in my school's tech classroom. I have used this printer for various tech projects for school and assisted our school's robotics team. Using this printer, I have created a rocket launch pad, motor brackets, and storage shelves; the possibilities are endless.¬†

There are many ways to help produce more knowledge in the world around us. A significant role a person could play heavily involves using their imagination to create objects to benefit society. A 3D printer uses software to take digital designs and, with a small quantity of technical knowledge, allows students and anyone to bring anything into the real world. Unfortunately, humans¬†don't¬†have the power to create matter with just our fingertips; we have to turn to technology. This perspective of the creative human creating and designing objects brings to light the idea that anyone can create anything they want: "The opportunity to create and innovate in areas never imaginable... is now open." (3Dknowledge.com) The role a 3D printer has is¬†to¬†deliver a person's imagination into the real world, helping to create new knowledge. The imaginative process we have been gifted, along with the power of technology, allows us to imagine and create simultaneously, bringing the world further knowledge and innovation.¬†

A 3D printer is unique as it gives everyone the ability, with just a little technical ability, to take any imagined design and bring it into the real world, creating new knowledge. This object plays the role of a creator, allowing the imagination to create new knowledge that is brought to the world.

**Commentary for object 2:**

Above is a picture of an experiment attempting to create the first electrical lightbulb. Thomas Edison used this carbon-filament bulb in the first public demonstration of his most famous invention‚Äîthe light bulb, the first practical electric incandescent lamp. (Smithsonian)¬†I¬†have no connection to this lightbulb; however, in the grand scheme, the invention of the electric lightbulb gives us more time to do our primary tasks and school work.¬†

Imagination serves as a means to pursue change or greatness in the world. The lightbulb was invented because someone imagined it first. Thomas Edison imagined a world with clean electrical lights instead of gas and oil lamps in every home. The lightbulb came first from his imagination and served as motivation to bring his vision to fruition. Had Mr. Edison's imagination never conjured this vision, it may have been many years before the world received electrical light sources: his imagination and the subsequent action brought forth new knowledge. In this case new knowledge is in the form of a new and innovative light source. Imagination was the root cause of this entire process from the start of the patent to the worldwide affect. The power of the human mind¬†is exemplified¬†by its ability to envision a positive future. Imagination allows us to envision what we want to happen and bring about new knowledge.

The lightbulb is unique not only because of its symbolism of a new idea but also because of the context behind its creation. This object is relevant because it shows the power of manifestation through imagination‚Äîthe human's ability to imagine, pursue positive action, and gain new knowledge in the world.

**Commentary for object 3:**

The above object is a princess-matching game. The point of the game is to match pairs of princesses, flowers, and even pets. As a child, a sibling frequently challenged me to see who had the better brain. To play the game, you take turns flipping over cards to eventually make pairs; whoever had the most pairs by the end would win. It would take a lot of memorization and imagination to help win this game (or lose).

This object represents how our imagination allows us to memorize aspects of life and make deep connections. The matching game tries to challenge an individual brains to keep information quickly and make connections between cards. Imagination is the most significant contributor to this brain function. Imagination aids the connections created in an individuals brain, and these connections increase knowledge gained. This knowledge comes from new ideas and concepts created in this web of connections. They are showing how the role that imagination plays is the ability to make meaningful connections. These connections help further knowledge by the generation of new ideas. New ideas allow us to explore the world and gain new knowledge from the daily connections we can make.¬†

This matching game is quite interesting because it shows how memorization increases an individual's knowledge. The deep connections of an an individual brain brain can allow us to connect seemingly unrelated topics. The imagination plays the role of connecting ideas to form new knowledge through memorization and experiencing life
