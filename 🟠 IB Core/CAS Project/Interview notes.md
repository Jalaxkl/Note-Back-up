- create system for sensitive items 
- inventory of items 

Zander messge:
Hey Bro, could you look into a software that allows you to track items in a classroom, like when someone is using something the teacher can know who is was and then when they return it they have to input it into the system and then the teacher knows as well, there might be something for it, this is for CAS btw so the sooner you have time for it the better!
