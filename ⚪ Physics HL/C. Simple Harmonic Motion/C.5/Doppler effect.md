- spectral lines

**_Students will understand:_** 

- the nature of the Doppler effect for sound waves and electromagnetic waves
- the representation of the Doppler effect in terms of wavefront diagrams when either the source or the observer is moving
- the relative change in frequency or wavelength observed for a light wave due to the Doppler effect where the speed of light is much larger than the relative speed between the source and the observer as given by Δƒ/ƒ = Δλ/λ ≈v/c
- that shifts in spectral lines provide information about the motion of bodies like stars and galaxies in space.

# Doppler effect 

- When the observer and the source of sound are moving relative to each other
- Only an apparent change not an actual change 

- Waves moving away from the observer are red-shifted (going more red)
	- Waves shift to the red end of s light spectrum
	- Waves appear at a lower frequency

- Waves moving toward the observer are blue-shifted
	- Waves shift to the blue end of light spectrum
	- Waves appear at a higher frequency

Its a proportional relation to frequency and wavelength 
$$
\frac{\Delta f}{f}= \frac{\Delta\lambda}{\lambda}\dots=\frac{\Delta v}{c}
$$

$\Delta$ f = change in frequency 
f= refrence (original frequency)
$\lambda$ = Original wavelength 
$\Delta$ $\lambda$ = change in wavelength 
v= Relative velocity 
c= speed of light


Change in wavelength can be calculated same with velocity 

Doppler shift has no units 

## Galactic Red shift 
*Definition*: The fractional increase in wavelength (or decrease in frequency) due to the source and observer receding from each other 
*Simple words*: Doppler effect in space when spectra of distance stars and galaxies are observed, this is known as
*Units*: 
*Measured with:* 
*Equation*: 

- This theory shows that the universe is always expanding 

### Spectra from a moving light source
*Definition*:
*Simple words*: Certain gasses will absorbe certain wavlengths of light when heated. Applying speed you can also use doppler effect 
*Units*: 
*Measured with:* 
*Equation*:

### Positive and Negative velocities 
- If the speed of the galaxy relative to earth is positive then the galaxy is moving toward the earth. 
	- This is the case when the observed frequency is greater than the reference frequency. 


## Equation of the Doppler Effect 
*Definition*: When a source of sound waves moves relative to a stationary observer, the observed frequency can be calculated using the equation below. 
*Simple words*: Doppler effect of sound
*Units*: 
*Measured with:* 
*Equation*: Moving sound source: $$

f'=f\left( \frac{V}{V\pm Us } \right)
$$
f'= Observed frequency 
f= Source Frequency 
V= Wave velocity (how fast the wave is going)
Us= Source Velocity (how fast the object producing the wave is going)

- If the source is going toward you, the observed frequency will increase 
	- Because of this the denominator needs to be smaller and therefore you **subtract** the wave velocity and source velocity 
	- If the object is going away from you you add the remaining velocities 


*Equation*: Moving Observer frequency$$
f'=f\left( \frac{V\pm Us}{V} \right)

$$
f' = observed frequency 
f= Source Frequency 
V= Wave velocity (how fast the wave is going)
Us= Source Velocity (how fast the object producing the wave is going)

- The +- depends on wheater the observer is moving towards or away from the source 
	- If the observer is **moving *toward* the Source you *add*** 
	- If the observer is **moving *away* from the source you *Subtract***


Using wavelength instead 
$$ 
\lambda'=\lambda\left( 1+\frac{Us}{V } \right)
$$
$\lambda$' = Observed wavelength 
$\lambda$ = Source Wavelength 

- Towards the source you subtract 
- Away from the Source you add 
	- (Same as first one)
