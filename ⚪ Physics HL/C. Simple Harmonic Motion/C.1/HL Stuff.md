# Overview 

**_Additional higher level:_**

- that a particle undergoing simple harmonic motion can be described using phase angle
- that problems can be solved using the equations for simple harmonic motion as given by 
                   x = x0 sin (ωt + ϕ) 
                   v = ωx0 cos (ωt + ϕ) 
                   v = ±ω(x02–x2) -½ 
                 ET = ½ mω2x02 
                 Ep = ½mω2x2.

# New Equations!

## ***When time=0 is at the equilibrium position!*** 

*Definition*: For a body that begins oscillating from its eqilibrium position, its displacement, velocity and acceleration can be described by the following scenarios
*Equation*: $$ x=X0*sin*\omega t....X0*sin*2\pi f$$

If we wanted to go to a velocity time graph:
*Equation* $$ v=\omega X0 *cos*\omega *t$$

If we then wanted an acceleration equation 
*Equation*$$
a=-\omega ^2*Xo*sin*\omega*t
$$

Key:
X0= amplitude 
$\omega$ = 2$\pi$ f (Angular frequency)
a=-$\omega$ Xo 
v= velocity of oscillator 
x= displacement of oscillator 
t= time


## ***When time=0 is at the amplitude position*** 
Phase shift

*Definition*: For a body that begins oscillating from its eqilibrium position, its displacement, velocity and acceleration can be described by the following scenarios
*Equation*: $$ x=X0*cos*\omega t....X0*sin*2\pi f$$

If we wanted to go to a velocity time graph:
*Equation* $$ v=-\omega X0 *sin*\omega *t$$

If we then wanted an acceleration equation 
*Equation*$$
a=-\omega ^2*Xo*cos*\omega*t
$$

Key:
X0= amplitude 
$\omega$ = 2$\pi$ f (Angular frequency)
a=-$\omega$ Xo 
v= velocity of oscillator 
x= displacement of oscillator 
t= time


		YOU can see from the two things above that it truly just matters how you draw the graph, because the 'sin or cos' only matters from where the objects starts its osciliation, its really all in the graph.

## ***What is the velocity at different positions?***

*Definition*: The variation of an oscillators velocity with its displacement x is defined by 

*Equation:* $$
v=+- \omega *\sqrt{(X0^2-x^2)}
$$

- The equation shows that the larger the amplitude X0 of an oscilaition, the greater the the distance it must travel in a given time period 
- Hance the faster it travels the closer it is to the equlirbium position

## ***Origin of the displacement Equation***


### At Equilibrium position 
*Equation*: $$ x=X0*sin (\omega t+\phi)$$
Φ = phase difference (radians) = 0


•The graph of x = sin (t)starts from amplitude xo = 0 when the pendulum is in the equilibrium position at t = 0
•The displacement is at its maximum when sin(⍵t) equals 1 or −1, when x = xo


---
### At Amplitude position 
*Equation*: $$ x=X0*cos (\omega t+\phi)$$
Φ = phase difference (radians) = 0

•The displacement will be at its maximum when cos(⍵t) equals 1 or −1, when x = xo

•This is because the cosine graph starts at a maximum, whereas the sine graph starts at 0

		Notice the differnce is the derivite of one another

# Energy Equations

## Potential Energy
*Definition*: Because it equal kinetic energy, we can use systems of equations to figure it out. 
*Simple words*: Potential energy in SMH
*Equation*: $$ 
Ek=\frac{1}{2}*m*\omega ^2*x^2
$$


## Total Energy 
*Simple words*: Total energy of the system at that point
*Equation*: $$\frac{1}{2}*m*\omega ^2*X0^2
$$


## Kinetic Energy displacement relation 
*Definition*:
*Simple words*: 
*Units*: 
*Measured with:* 
*Equation*: $$ \frac{1}{2}*m*\omega ^2*(X0^2-x^2)$$

		Ep=Ek=ET 
		Potential=Kinetic=Total



# Phase angles

## Phase angles
*Definition*: Two points on a sin wave, or on different waves, are in phase when they are at the same point in their wave cycle
*Simple words*: The angle between their wave cycles is knows as the phase angle

![[Screenshot 2024-10-22 at 2.20.55 PM.png]]

- Is an oscillation does NOT start from the equilibrium position, then it will be out of phase by an angle of $\phi$ 

- Difference in angular displacement compared to an oscilator which as a displacement of 0 initially 
	- Can vary from anywhere form 0 --> 2$\pi$ Radians

*New equation: (as in the data booklet)*
![[Screenshot 2024-10-22 at 2.30.07 PM.png]]

- if two bodies oscilate with same frequency and amplitude but are out of phase by     $\pi$ /2 
	- The displacement of the oscilator is represented by this:$$ x=X0*sin(\omega*t-\frac{\pi}{2})$$

- If the out of phase leads then it will be negative 
	- **Then it becomes a cos wave** 
- If the out of phase follows then it will be positive 
	- **Then it becomes a Sin Wave**
