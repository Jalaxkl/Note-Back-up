# Notes
## Oscillation

## Simple Harmonic Motion
*Definition*: Periodic motion around a central point of equilibrium where there is no net force. There is a restoring force that acts on the object that is directly proportional to the displacement from the equilibrium position and acts in a direction opposite to that displacement 
*Simple words*: Acceleration is proportional to the horizontal or vertical displacement
*Units*: 
*Measured with:* 
*Equation*: $$
a=\omega^2 x....a∝-x
$$

- There is repetitive movement back and forth 
- The time interval between each oscillation is the same 
- The force responsible for the motion (Restoring force)
	- Always directed horizontally or vertically towards the equilibrium position
	- Directly proportional to the distance of the equilibrium position

*Simple words*: Moving an object back and forth 
*Measured with:*

- Equilibrium position x=0
	- The point were NO resultant force is acting on the object (at rest)


#### Time Period of a Simple Pendulum 

$$ T= 2\pi \sqrt{\frac{L}{g}}$$
T= Time period 
L= Length of String 
g= gravitational Field Strength 

###### Fun Math Stuff
$$
a=-(\frac{G}{L})x

$$

Defining equation for the equation for simple harmonic motion 

- This equation will vary for each situation (it will be given)
	- But if its in this form, it is oscillating and it is in simple harmonic motion. 

$$ 
\omega= \sqrt(\frac{G}{L})
$$

#### Time period for a mass spring system 

- Mass attached to a spring in oscillation

- Larger spring constant = smaller period 
- Smaller spring constant = larger period 

$$ 
T=2\pi \sqrt(m/k)
$$
m= mass 
k= spring constant

## Restoring Force
*Definition*: The force that brings to osilation to the point of orgin along hte horizontal or vertical axis
*Simple words*: Is the weight component acting along the arc of the circle towards the equilibrium position 
*Equation*: 

- The smaller the angle from the origin, 

- If the angle is so close to 0 we can use the **small angle approximations** 
	- sin $\theta$ = $\theta$
