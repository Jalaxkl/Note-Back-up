- nodes and antinodes, relative amplitude and phase difference of points along a standing wave
- standing waves patterns in strings and pipes
- the nature of resonance including natural frequency and amplitude of oscillation based on driving frequency
- the effect of damping on the maximum amplitude and resonant frequency of oscillation
- the effects of light, critical and heavy damping on the system.

# Standing Waves 

## Stationary (Standing) Waves
*Definition*: 
*Simple words*: 
*Units*: 
*Measured with:* 
*Equation*: 

- Nodes 
	- Points with NO amplitude and 0 energy 
	- There will always be 1 more node than antinodes 

- Antinodes 
	- Points with Maximum amplitude 

- Characteristics 
	- Points that are not nodes are in phase 
	- Energy is stored NOT transfered 
	- Each point oscillates at a different speed, the overall wave does not move 

## Progressive waves
*Definition*: Waves that travel in a medium 
*Simple words*: 
*Units*: 
*Measured with:* 
*Equation*: 

- All points in the same wave have the same amplitude 

## Boundary Condition
*Definition*: How many ends or connections does a medium have?
- Whether the waves travels between two fixed ends, or two free ends and any combination of those

##### Guitar String:
- Different frequencies with different notes depending on the tension
- Mass per unit length, different thickness 
- Different natural frequencies --> different nodes and anti-nodes

##### Pipes:
- More than one possible boundary:
	- Closed at both ends
	- Open at both ends
	- Open at ONE end 

- Antinodes always appear at the open end. 
- At closed end there is always a node 

##### Harmonics in Strings
- Harmonics are the only frequencies and wavelengths that will form standing waves on strings or in pipes. 
- Number of anti nodes determines the harmonic
	- First harmonic:
		- $\lambda$ =2L 
		- Two nodes (at each end only)
	- Second Harmonic 
		- $\lambda$ = L
	- Fourth Harmonic 
		- $\lambda$ = L/2
	- Nth harmonic 
		- N+1 nodes and N antinodes 
		- General expression --> $\lambda$ = 2L/n
		- Natural frequency --> f =N* v/ 2L

##### Harmonics in PIPES
- Number of **nodes** determines the harmonic
	- First harmonic:
		- L=$\lambda$ /2 
	- Second Harmonic 
		- L=$\lambda$
	- Third Harmonic 
		- L=3$\lambda$ /2
	- Fourth Harmonic 
		- $\lambda$ = L/2
	- Nth harmonic 
		- N+1 nodes and N antinodes 
		- General expression --> $\lambda$ = 2L/n
		- Natural frequency --> f =N* v/ 2L

##### One one open end 
- Veyr werid and frequently only happens in pipes 
- One open end (always an antinode)
	- Read it based on the graph
	- First Harmonic
		- L=$\lambda$ /4
	- Third harmonic 
		- L=3$\lambda$ /4
	- Firth Harmonic 
		- L=5$\lambda$ /4

Open and closed 
$$ f=\frac{nv}{ 4L}$$

Fixed and opened
$$ f=\frac{nv}{2L}$$

# Resonance
## Free oscillations
*Definition*: An oscillation where there are only internal forces (and no external forces) acting and there is no energy input 
*Simple words*: Always vibrates at its resonant frequency 
*Units*: 
*Measured with:* 
*Equation*: 

- In practice only happens in a vacuum 
- 


## Resonance
*Definition*: When the frequency of the applied force to an oscillating system is equal to its natural frequency, the amplitude of the resulting oscillations is at its maximum. 
*Simple words*: When the oscillating system is allowed to oscilate freely 
*Units*: 
*Measured with:* 
*Equation*: 

Types:
- Light 
	- When the oscillations are lightly damped 
- Critical 
	- An oscilator will return to rest at its equilibrium position in the shortest possible time without oscillating. (from amplitude to origin position)
- Heavy 
	- Critical but slower 

## Damping
*Definition*:
*Simple words*: Decreasing amplitude due to resistance
*Units*: 
*Measured with:* 
*Equation*:
