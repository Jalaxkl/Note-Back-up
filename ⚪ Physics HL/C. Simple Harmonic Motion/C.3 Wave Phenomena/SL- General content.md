**_Students will understand:_**  

- that waves travelling in two and three dimensions can be described through the concepts of wavefronts and rays
- wave behaviour at boundaries in terms of reflection, refraction and transmission
- wave diffraction around a body and through an aperture
- wavefront-ray diagrams showing refraction and diffraction
- Snell’s law, critical angle and total internal reflection
- Snell’s law as given by _n_1/_n_2= sin _θ_2/sin _θ_1= _v_2/_v_1 where _n_ is the refractive index and _θ_ is the angle between the normal and the ray
- superposition of waves and wave pulses
- that double-source interference requires coherent sources
- the condition for constructive interference as given by path difference = _nλ_
- the condition for destructive interference as given by path difference = (n +1/2)λ
- Young’s double-slit interference as given by s = λD/d where s is the separation of fringes, d is the separation of the slits, and D is the distance from the slits to the screen.

# Wave Phenomena 

## Diffraction through a single-slit and around objects
*Definition*: The wave will be bent through a process called Diffraction
*Simple words*: Diffraction

### Huygen Principle 

"Every point on a wavefront emits a spherical wavelet of the same velocity and wavelength as the original wave "

- This is how waves can turn corners.

## Rays
*Definition*:
*Simple words*: 
*Units*: 
*Measured with:* 
*Equation*: 

## Snell's Law
*Definition*: Relates the waves velocities in two mediums to their angles
*Simple words*: How to find the speed or angle of particles entering a medium
*Equation*: $$ 
\frac{v2}{v1}=\frac{\sin\theta2}{\sin\theta1}
$$

- Your second medium is on top. 


## Critical Angle
*Definition*: 
*Simple words*: The angle at which light reflects perpendicularly to the normal 
*Units*: 
*Measured with:* 
*Equation*: $$ 
sin C=\frac{n2}{n}
$$

- If a angle is larger than the cirtical angle then all the light will internally reflect 


## Superposition of Waves 
*Definition*: When waves in the same medium go through each other they can cancel or add to each others amplitude
*Simple words*: Amplitudes add together when they interact 
*Equation*: 
Just adding or subtracting (if on the negative axis) 

- Have to be in the same medium 

- Perfect deconstructive interference occurs when two superimposed waves have a phase shift of $\pi$ or 180deg

Two Point interference:
- When two points that produce a wave are close to interfere with each other 



### Constructive interference

## Young Double slit experiment
*Definition*: When plane waves hit a split or opening, point sources are created
*Simple words*: You get both destructuve and constrictive 
*Units*: 
*Measured with:* 
*Equation*: $$ 
s=(n)\lambda *D/d
$$
$\lambda$ = frequency 
D = Distance from screen 
d= seperation of the slits 
s= distance from bright fringes 
n= seperation distance 

MonoChromatic light: Light with the same color and hence frequency

## Path difference
*Definition*: How to determin destrictive and constructive interference
*Simple words*: 
*Units*: 
*Measured with:* 
*Equation*: $$
(n+1/2)λ = Destructive

$$
$$ n+λ = Constructive $$
