# What is the width of the slit itself?

## Vocab word 
*Definition*: How do we determin the width of the slit 
*Simple words*: This effects how the central maximum and its fringes are in size
*Equation*: $$ 
θ= \frac{\lambda}{ b}$$
b= Width of the slit (NOT SEPERATION OF SLITS)
θ = angle from midpoint of central maximum to the first dark fringe 


- Larger gap:
	- Narrower central maximum 
	- More intensity. 

ALSO:
$$ 
\frac{\lambda}{b }= \frac{d}{D }
$$

More importantly:$$

d= \frac{\lambda*D}{b}
$$
d= separation of slits 
D= Distance from the slits 
b= Slit width 
$\lambda$ = Wavelength


## Optical gratings 
*Definition*: Produces a continuous spectrum from a light source 
*Simple words*: 
*Units*: 
*Measured with:* 
*Equation*: $$
n\lambda = d*\sinθ
$$

- Atoms of certain gasses can absorb different wavelengths of the spectrum 
	- Thus will not be shown on the spectrometer 

- As the same gas cools, the same frequency it absorbed will give off the energy it absorbed
