# Photoelectric effect 

## Photoelectric effect
*Definition*: Phenomenon in which electrons are emitted from the surface of a metal upon the absorption of electromagnetic radiation 
*Simple words*: Electrons are removed from the surface of metals this way 
*Units*: 
*Measured with:* 
*Equation*: $$
E_{max}= h*f-\phi
$$
E= Kinetic Energy 
h= Planks constant 
f= frequency of incident light (Hz)
$\phi$ = work function (J)

- Provides evidence that light is both a wave and a particle 
	- Light is quantized or carried in discrete packets
	- Each electrons can absorb only A SINGLE photon 
	- ![[Screenshot 2025-01-21 at 1.35.01 PM.png]]
Can this only apply to metals? 
- Because they must be conductors of electricity 

- Intensity does not effect the energy of the photon 

## Threshold Frequency: 
*Definition*: The minimum frequency of incident electromagnetic radiation required to remove a photoelectron from the surface of a metal
*Simple words*: A property of the LIGHT
*Units*: 
*Measured with:* 
*Equation*: 

- Different metals are going to react and have different threshold frequencies of light
- More attraction requires a larger threshold frequency 


## Work Function: $\phi$ 
*Definition*: Minimum energy required to release a photoelectron from the surface of a metal 
*Simple words*: Property that belongs to METAL
*Units*: 
*Measured with:* 
*Equation*: 

- One electron absorbs one photon 
- The electron can only escape from the surface of the metal if it absorbs a photon which has an energy equal to the work function of higher

- Different metals have different threshold frequencies and thus different work functions
	- More 'tight' electrons will require more energy 
	- Alkali (Sodium and potassium) have a threshold frequency in the visible light range 
	- Transition metals (Zine, Iron) have threshold frequencies in the ultraviolet raneg

## Effect of Intensity
*Definition*:  Intensity increases the number of elections being emitted will also increase 
*Simple words*: Power per unit area
*Units*: 
*Measured with:* 
*Equation*: 

- Intensity increases the number of elections being emitted will also increase 
- There is no relationship between intensity and speed of electrons 
	- One photon can only be absorbed by ONE electron 

- The photoelectrons with maximum kinetic energy will be those on the surface of the metal
- Photoelectrons with lower kinetic energy are those deeper within the metal (not surface)

## Photoelectric current 
*Definition*: number of photoelectrons emitted per second from the metal
*Simple words*: Proportional to the intensity of radiation incident on the surface
*Units*: 
*Measured with:* 
*Equation*: $$
\#electronsEmitted*Charge_{ONEelectron}
$$

## Stopping Potential
*Definition*: Potential difference (of a power) source required to stop photoelectrons emission from occurring
*Simple words*: 
*Units*: 
*Measured with:* 
*Equation*: $$
V_{s}= \frac{W}{Q }=\frac{E}{Q}=\frac{E_{max}}{e}
$$
Maximum kinetic energy per electron
Therefore:$$
E_{max}=e*V_{s}
$$
Emax = maximum kinetic energy of the electrons 
e= elementary charge 
Vs= stopping voltage (stopping potential)


- if the EMF is initially 0 the ciruit operates only on the photoelectric current. 
- When the voltage is turned up
	- As a result the electrons leaving the emitter plate are attracted back toward it.
	- This is registered on the current meter as 0 
- 
- ![[Screenshot 2025-01-23 at 11.40.12 AM.png]]
- When you increase the kinetic energy you must also increase the stopping potential 

- Changing the frequency while keeping intensity constant
	- Increasein ghte frequency increases the energy of inidividual photon 
	- Maintains the same intensity 
	- Fewer photon means a lower current 


### Intensity vs Stopping potential

All metals will have the same stopping potential 


# is Light a Wave or Particle?
## Particle Nature of Light
*Definition*: 
*Simple words*: 
*Units*: 
*Measured with:* 
*Equation*: 

- Setup:
	- Plate of metal (usually zinc) attached to a rod with gold leaf on the end 
		- Plate is negatively charged causing the leaflets to be repelled
	- When the system is negatively charged and you put incident light 
		- You lose electrons from the photo electric effect(negativly charged systems have an excess)
		- Because of the less electrons the system becomes positively charged and the leaflet falls. 

- Lower Frequency light does not work
	- No electrons are emitted
		- Lower frequency photo lack the energy to free electrons 
- Higher intensities light sitll oes not work 
	- Intensity does not mean that more energy in the released electrons 

Thus light is a particle because the electrons cannot absorbe light they can only be incident once and not continuoisly 

# De Broglie Wavelength
## De Broglie Wavelength
*Definition*:
*Simple words*: Electrons behave like waves
*Units*: 
*Equation*: $$
\lambda =\frac{h}{p}=\frac{h}{ m*v}

$$
h= Plank constant 
p= Momentum particle 

Making it more complicated
$$
E_{k}= \frac{p^2}{2m}
$$
OR $$
\lambda = \frac{h}{\sqrt{ 2*m*E_{k} }}
$$
Additionally:$$
n\lambda = d\sinθ \to sin⁡θ=\frac{\lambda}{d }
$$
D= spacing for diffraction 
$\lambda$ = debroglie wavelength 
⁡θ= angle of diffraction 


- The wavelength associated with moving particles 
	- All particle have wave like particle and a **matter wave** link to their motion 
	- Related to particles momentum p

- Increasing the voltage of the electron 
	- Increases electron speed, momentum and kinetic energy 
	- Decreases the wavelength
	- Electron diffraction provided the first evidence that electrons behave in a wave
	- De Broglie wavelength can be used to calculate the angle of the first maximum in the diffraction pattern 


## Wave Particle Duality  
*Definition*: Light is both a particle and a wave
*Simple words*: 

- Wave Behavior (does not explain photoelectric effect)
	- Diffraction and interference 
	- Kinetic energy depends on intensity 

- Particle behavior
	- Shown by photoelectric effect 
	- Photon carry discrete energy that are instantly translated 
		- Photoelectric effect electrons can only absorbe ONE photon

--- 
## Compton scattering of light
*Definition*: The interaction of a high-energy photon with an orbital electron which causes an increase in the wavelength of the photon and the ejection of the electron
*Simple words*: Another way for light particle nature 
*Units*: 
*Measured with:* 
*Equation*: $$
\Delta\lambda= \frac{h}{m_{e}*c}*(1-\cos{0})

$$
h= planks constant 
m= mass of electron 
cos0= scattering angle of the photon 
c= speed of light 
$\Delta$ $\lambda$ = change in wavelenth of the photon

- Energy is transfered, the photon and atom go in different directions due to conservation of momentum 
	- Photon is deflected from its initial path 
	- Wavelength increases and energy decreases 
	- Electron is ejected form the atom

- The reduced wavelength depends on the photon's scattering angle 
- Larger scattering angle = a longer wavelength 
- Assumes the electron is as rest...?
