# Overview
**_Learning objectives:_**

**_Students will understand:_**

- fusion
- outward radiation pressure
- stellar mass
- Hertzsprung-Russell (HR) diagrams
- stellar parallax

**_Students will understand:_**  

- that the stability of stars relies on an equilibrium between outward radiation pressure and inward gravitational forces
    
- that fusion is a source of energy in stars
    
- the conditions leading to fusion in stars in terms of density and temperature
    
- the effect of stellar mass on the evolution of a star
    
- the main regions of the Hertzsprung–Russell (HR) diagram and how to describe the main properties of stars in these regions
    
- the use of stellar parallax as a method to determine the distance _d_ to celestial bodies as given by _d_(parsec) = 1/_p_(arc‐second)
    
- how to determine stellar radii.
