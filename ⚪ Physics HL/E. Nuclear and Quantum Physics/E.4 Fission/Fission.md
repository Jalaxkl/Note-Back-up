# Overview:

**_Learning objectives:_**

**_Students will understand:_**

- neutron-induced fission
- chain reaction
- control rods
- moderators
- heat exchangers

**_Students will understand:_**  

- that energy is released in spontaneous and neutron-induced fission
    
- the role of chain reactions in nuclear fission reactions
    
- the role of control rods, moderators, heat exchangers and shielding in a nuclear power plant
    
- the properties of the products of nuclear fission and their management.


# Notes

## Chain Reactions from Critical Mass 
*Definition*: Minimum fuel amount needed to maintain a steady chain reaction
*Simple words*: 
*Measured with:* 
*Equation*: 

- Subcritical mass
	- Too little fuel - reaction stops

- Supercritical Mass
	- Too Much Fuel - Reaction runs away, causing an explosion 

## Operation of a nuclear reactor
*Definition*: Notes on operating a nuclear reactor as it utilizes almost entierly fission

- A chain reaction is required to keep the reactor running 
- Two factors must be controlled to produce steady energy 
	- Number of free neutrons 
	- Energy of free neutrons 
- Main components 
	- Control rods
	- moderators
	- heat exchangers 
	- shielding

## Radioactive waste managment 
*Definition*:

Advantages
- No greenhouse emission --> Climate friendly 
- High energy density --> produces more energy per kg 
- Fuel availability --> uranium reserves last longer than fossil fuels 

Disadvantage:
- Hazardous waste which is dangerous for thousands of years 
- Risk of catastrophic accidents like Chernobyl
- Potential for misuse --> risk of nuclear weapons or terrorist uses. 

Environmental concerns 
- Prevent contamination 
- Burial sites must be stable 
- Limited space for storage 

Safety measure 
- Fuel rods must be handled by machines 
- Thick led or concrete for shielding 
- Safe emergency shut down 

Nuclear Energy in society 
- Public fear 
- Education on how safe nuclear power actually is
