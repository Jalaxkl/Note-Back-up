# Rutherford scattering an Nuclear Radius 

## Nuclear Radius 
*Definition*: The radius of the atom
*Simple words*: The radius of the entire atom (including the cloud of electrons)
*Equation*: There is a theoryized relationship $$

R= R_{0}*A^{1/3}
$$
R0= Fermi radius 
R = nuclear radius 
A= Nucleon/mass number 

- The radius of the nuclear depends on the nuclean number 
	- Great number of nucleons, the larger the radius


## Nuclear Density 
*Definition*: 
*Simple words*: How dense an atom is
*Equation*: 
Assuming the nuclear is sphefiercal, its volume is equal to 
$$ v=\frac{4}{3}\pi *R^3$$
R = nuclear radius: $$
R= R_{0}*A^{1/3}

$$
Combining them you get the volume of the atom $$ 
V= \frac{4}{3} \pi (R_{0}A^{1/3})$$
To find mass you find the Unified atomic mass with the number of neutrons 
$$m=Au $$
A = Atomic Mass unit 
u = unifed atomic mass 

Combining this with the original density equation $$
\rho = \frac{Au}{\frac{4}{3}*\pi*R_{0}^{3}A}
$$
Simplifying it we get $$
\frac{3u}{4\pi*R_{0}^{3}}
$$
Because all the vairables now are constants we can populate them and simplify. 
All atoms irrespective of their atomic numbers have the same density.

## Rutherford Scattering Experiment 
*Definition*: Alpha particles are fired at a gold foil, the particles have kinetic energy 
*Simple words*: Some of the particles are found to come straight back form the gold foil. There is am electrostatic repulsion between the gold and alpha particles. 
*Equation*: 

Point of closes approach: d 

- The repulsive force moves the alpha particles to 0 velocity 
	- At this point the kinetic energy has all transferred to potential energy and therefore the alpha particle starts to accelerate backwards. 

Electric potential is given by:$$
E_{p} = k*\frac{Q*q}{d}
$$
Q = Charge of an Alpha particle 2x the elementary charge 
q= charge of the Particle zx the elementary charge 
k= Coulomb Constant 
d= Point of closes approach 

TO find the point of closes approach:$$
d=k*\frac{2*z*e^2}{Ep}
$$
Z= the proton number of the other particle. 

VERY SIMILAR TO D.2 ELECTRICAL POTENTIAL ENERGY 

#### Deviations 

Experiment predicted:
- As the scattering angle increases, the number of alpha particles scattered at that angle decreases. 
	- Only found to be correct at low to moderatly high energies 
- However at high energies (>27.5) significant deviations occured

The only explanation was that the alpha particles overcame the 'strong nuclear force' and there fore the alpha particles became absorbed into the gold particles 

- Therefore, deviations from the Rutherford scattering provided evidence for the strong nuclear force

### Strong Nuclear Force

Strong nuclear force is porportional to the nuclear radius 


## Bohr model for hydrogen
*Definition*:
Equation:$$
En=- \frac{13.6}{n^2}eV
$$
ONLY APPLICABlE TO HYDROGEN 

E= photon energy 
n= interger as the energy level of the elctron 

- Simplest atom in existence
- Spectral lines produced by hydrogen atoms showed:
	- Electrons are able to jump or transition,between specific energy levels producing specific energy photons
	- different transitions can be categorized into series 

- Lyman series converges to the ground state (n=1)
	- Have the highest energies as they make the greatest transitions 
	- Tend to produce ultraviolet protons

- Balmer serier converge to the second energy levels (n=2)

- Ritz-pachan from the 3rd energy level (n=3)

- Helped understands how photons work to produce photons of specific wavelengths and energies 
	- Electrons can only move in a fixed orbit 
	- Orbital radius of electrons is restricted to certain values 

### Quantization of Angular Momentum

Angular momentum equation: L=I * $\omega$ (Moment of Inertia * Angular speed)

- magnitude is equal to the momentum of the particle times it radial distance from the centre of its orbit 
	- Direction is given by the right-hand corkscrew rule. 

Equation:$$
L=n* \frac{h}{2\pi}
$$
L = Angular momentum 
n = energy level 
h = planks constant 


Additionally there is a proposed electron with momentum also has a wavelength 
$$
\lambda=\frac{h}{p}
$$
 p = m * v is the momentum

This creates a ***Matter Wave*** despite the electron not oscillating it still creates a wave. 

If the electron is moving in a straight line![[Screenshot 2025-01-17 at 8.54.25 AM.png]]
##### Two things can happen to electrons in orbit then:


1) normal orbit 
When the electron is orbiting

2) the electron creates deconstructive interference. 
![[Screenshot 2025-01-17 at 8.56.06 AM.png]]

Hence the circumfrance must equal to tinteger number of wavelengths $$ 
n\lambda= 2\pi*r$$
