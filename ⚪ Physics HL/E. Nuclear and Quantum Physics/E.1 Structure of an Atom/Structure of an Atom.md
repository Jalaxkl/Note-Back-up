**_Students will understand:_**  

- the Geiger–Marsden–Rutherford experiment and the discovery of the nucleus
- nuclear notation _AZ_X where _A_ is the nucleon number _Z_ is the proton number and X is the chemical symbol
    
- that emission and absorption spectra provide evidence for discrete atomic energy levels
    
- that photons are emitted and absorbed during atomic transitions
    
- that the frequency of the photon released during an atomic transition depends on the difference in energy level as given by _E_ = _hƒ_
    
- that emission and absorption spectra provide information on the chemical composition.

# Emission and Absorption Spectra 
## Atomic Spectra 
*Definition*: Observed when atoms emit or absorb light of certain wavelengths (known as emission or absorption spectra)
*Simple words*: How light behaves in relation to heat 
*Units*: 
*Measured with:* 
*Equation*: 

- Atomic Spectra provides evidence that electrons in atoms can only transition between different energy levels. 

- If you combine the Emission and Absorption spectra you get the full wavelength through the gas
- Each element produces a unique pattern (elements can b identified with their spectrum)

#### Emission Spectra 

- Emission spectra can be produced by heating a low pressure gas. 
	- Adds energy to a higher energy level 
	- When an electron transitions back to a lower energy level, it emits a photon 
- Each transitions corresponds to a certain wavelength
- Colored lines along a black background

#### Absorption Spectra

- When you take a cool, lower pressure gas and illuminate it with light. 
	- Only photons with the exact energy required to excite electrons will be absorbed

## Photon Energy 
*Definition*: A massless 'packet' or a 'quantum' of electromagnetic energy 
*Simple words*: Light or particle of light

- Photons are fundamental particles that make up all forms of electromagnetic radiation
	- Not continues energy but discrete 
		- Energy is transferred in one go and not over time 
		- Different from waves which are consistent 

*Equation:* $$ E=h*f ..OR..E=\frac{h*c}{\lambda}
$$
E= Energy (joules)
h= Planks Constant (Js) 6.63x10^-34
f= Frequency 

c= speed of light 
$\lambda$ = wavelength 

**Convert Electron volts to Joules** 


The Difference between two energy levels is equal to the specific photon energy $$
\lambda= \frac{h*c}{E_{2}-E_{1}}
$$
Normally:
$$ E_{2}-E_{1}=E=h*f$$
The larger the difference in energy between the two levels, the shorter the wavelength 

Negative Energy:
- Tells us how much energy we need to be added to get the object back to its 0 energy state

## Atomic Energy Levels 
*Definition*: 
*Simple words*: 
*Units*: 
*Measured with:* 
*Equation*: 

- Electrons in an atom occupy certain energy states called energy levels 
	- Electrons typically occupy the first energy level as its the most stable

- When an electron absorbs or emits a photon, it can move between these energy levels

## Excitation 
*Definition*: 
*Simple words*: When an electron moves to a higher energy level, the atom is in an excited state 
*Units*: 
*Measured with:* 
*Equation*: 

- When an electron moves to a higher energy level, the atom is said to be in an excited state 
	- Must absore an photon 
- Electrons can also move back down to a lower energy level by de-excitation 
	- It will emit a photon 

#### Ionisation 

- When an electron is removed from an atom, the atom becomes ionized
	- Ionisation energy of an atom is the minimum energy required to remove an electron from the ground state of an atom. 

Representing energy levels:

Line at the bottom is the ground state, the lines above are excitement levels 

The energy level at the bottom (-13.6) is the amount of energy required to take the electron into ionisation 

Largest wavelength have the shortest amount of change in energy levels 
Shortest wavelength has the greatest energy level change 

$$ \lambda=\frac{h*c}{E_{2}-E_{1}}

$$
$\lambda$ = Wavelenth of wave 
h = planks constant 
c = speed of light 
E = Energy in joules (need to convert from electron volts)
