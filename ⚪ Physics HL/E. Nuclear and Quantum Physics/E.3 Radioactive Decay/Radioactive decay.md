- the mass-energy equivalence as given by _E_ = _mc_2 in nuclear reactions
- the existence of the strong nuclear force, a short-range, attractive force between nucleons
- the random and spontaneous nature of radioactive decay
- the changes in the state of the nucleus following alpha, beta and gamma radioactive decay
- the radioactive decay equations involving _α_, _β_-, _β_+, _γ_
- the existence of neutrinos and antineutrinos
- the penetration and ionizing ability of alpha particles, beta particles and gamma rays
- the activity, count rate and half-life in radioactive decay

	- the effect of background radiation on count rate.

**_Additional higher level:_** 

- the evidence for the strong nuclear force
- the role of the ratio of neutrons to protons for the stability of nuclides
- the approximate constancy of binding energy curve above a nucleon number of 60
- that the spectrum of alpha and gamma radiations provides evidence for discrete nuclear energy levels
- the continuous spectrum of beta decay as evidence for the neutrino
- the decay constant _λ_ and the radioactive decay law as given by _N_ = _N_0_e_−_λt_
- that the decay constant approximates the probability of decay in unit time only in the limit of sufficiently small _λt_
- the activity as the rate of decay as given by _A_ = _λN_ = _λN_0_e_−_λt_
- the relationship between half-life and the decay constant as given by _T_½ = ln2/_λ_ .

# Radioactive Decay 

## Radioactive Decay 
*Definition*: The number of radioisotpe at any given point in time and the original number of radioisotopes are related 
*Simple words*: 
*Units*: 
*Measured with:* 
*Equation*: (years need to convert to seconds)$$ 
N=N_{0}e^{-\lambda*t}$$
N= number of radioisotopes remaining 
N_0 = Original number of particles 
$\lambda$ = Decay constant 
e= mathmatical e (not electrons)


## Half Life
*Definition*: The time taken for the original activity (mass) to half in value
*Simple words*: Each element has a unique half life
*Units*: 
*Measured with:* 
*Equation*: $$
N=\frac{1}{2}*N_{0}
$$
N= Sample after time
N_0= Original sample

Plugging this into the radioactive decay equation$$
\frac{1}{2}*N_{0}= N_{0}e^{-\lambda*t}
$$
We are looking for half life so time disappears to half life
$$\frac{1}{2}=e^{-\lambda*t_{1/2}}$$
Taking natural log..
$$
\ln(\frac{1}{2})=\lambda *t_{1/2}*
$$
$$t_{1/2}=\frac{\ln_(2)}{\lambda}$$

## Nuclear Stability
*Definition*:
*Simple words*: Most 
*Units*: 
*Measured with:* 
*Equation*: 

- Most common elements in the universe all tend to have values of N (neutrons) and Z (Protons) less than 20
- Lighter elements with fewer protons tend to have more stability because there are less nucleons

Line of stability
- Shows combination of neutrons (N) and protons (Z) that make a nuclei stable 
- Reasons atoms become unstable:
	- Too many neutrons 
	- Too many nucleons 
	- Too much energy 
- Generally below 20 they are very stable isotopes
- Higher than 20 atomic number you need more neutrons than protons to have a stable nuclei



## Nuclear Energy Levels 
*Definition*:
*Simple words*: 
*Units*: 
*Measured with:* 
*Equation*: 

- Nuclean can only exist in an excited state in the same way as an electron 
- Once an unstable nucleus has decyaed it may emit energy in the from of a gamma photon
