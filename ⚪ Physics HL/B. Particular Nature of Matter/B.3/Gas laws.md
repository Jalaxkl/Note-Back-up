# Intro to Gas Laws
## Pressure
*Definition*: The force exerted per unit area
*units*: N.m^-2 OR Pa (Pascals)

Physical quantity and depends on two things:
- How much **force** is applied 
- The **area** the force is applied. 
$$
P= \frac{F}{A}
$$
*P*= Pressure 
*F*= Force 
*A*= Area 

### Hydraulic Systems 
- used to be "force multipliers" 
	- Fluids apply the same amount of force over the area 

$$
P1= P2
$$
$$
\frac{F1}{A1}= \frac{F2}{A2}

$$
$$F2=\frac{F1*A2}{A1}$$

#### Pressure exerted by particles
$$
P=\frac{1}{3}*p*v^2
$$
P= Pressure 
V= mean square speed 
p= number of molecules (Can use avogadros constant for ONE molecule)

Mean square speed:
$$
v= \sqrt{\frac{3P}{p}}
$$


## Mole 
*Definition*:A mole is a **measure of the number of particles in a substance** 1 mole is 6x10^23 particles 
*Simple words*: Relative atomic mass expressed in grams 
*Units*: Gram per mole 
*Equation*: $$
No.ofMoles= \frac{{Mass(g)}}{ {MolarMass(g/mol)}}
$$


# Gas Laws
## Ideal Gas  
*Definition*: A gas that obeys ALL the gas laws irrespective of the conditions
*Simple words*: A gas obeying all the laws under all conditions **(doesn't exists)**
*Equation*: $$ \frac{PV}{T}=constant$$


## Boyle's Law
*Definition*: Pressure is inversely proportional to the volume of a gas, if temperature is constant (**isothermal**)

- The relationship between the pressure and volume for a fixed mass of gas at constant temperature 
*Simple words*: For a fixed mass of gas at constant temperature, the product of the pressure and volume is constant. 
*Equation*: $$ P1*V1=P2*V2$$
- P1= Initial Pressure 
- P2= Final Pressure 
- V1= Initial Volume 
- V2= Final Volume 


## Charles's Law
*Definition*: Volume is proportional to the temperature of the gas 
*Simple words*: 
*Units*: Temperature needs to be in kelvin
*Equation*: 
$$ \frac{V1}{T1}=\frac{V2}{T2}$$
V1= Initial Volume 
V2= Final Volume 
T1= Initial Temperature 
T2= Final Temperature 

## Gay-Lussac's Law
*Definition*: For a constant mass of gas at fixed volume, the pressure exerted by the gas is proportional to its absolute temperature. 
*Simple words*: Pressure is proportional to the temperature of a gas 
*Units*: 
*Measured with:* 
*Equation*: $$
\frac{P1}{T1}= \frac{P2}{T2}
$$
P1= Initial Pressure  
P2= Final Pressure  
T1= Initial Temperature 
T2= Final Temperature 

# IDEAL GAS EQUATION 
*Equation*: This one referes to the number of particles (Macroscopic)$$
P*V=n*R*T
$$
- P= Pressure 
- V= Volume 
- n= # of moles 
- R= 8.31 (Constant value)
- T= Temperature (IN KELVIN)

Equation: This one referes to the energy of the particles$$
P*V= N*Kb*T
$$
- P= Pressure 
- V= Volume 
- N= # of particles
- Kb = Boltzmanns constant 
- T= Temperature (IN KELVIN)

## Kinetic Theory of Gas 


*Assumptions of ideal gases:* (Hence why idela gases are impossible)

1. An ideal gas consists of identical molecules in constant random motion. They all have the same mass. 
2. Molecules never stop so collisions between molecules and the sides of the container are perfectly elastic (no kinetic energy loss )
3. Volume of the molecules is negligible compared to the volume of the container. This means they can be considered point particles 
4. There are no intermolecular forces between the molecules expect during collisions. External Forces are ignored. 
	- THE INTERNAL FORCES ARE ALL KINETIC 
5. The number of molecules of has in a container is very large. Therefore the average behavior (eg. speed) is usually considered. 

#### A real gas can act as an ideal gas when...
- The gas pressure is low 
- Gas density is low 
- Temperature is **sufficiently** higher than the boiling point of the substance 

This is because:
- Molecules are closer together 
- Volume of the molecules cannot be considered negligible 
- There are attractive forces between the molecules. 

# Internal Energy (u) 
*Definition*: Sun total of the Molecular Kinetic and Potential Energies 
*Simple words*: Kinetic and potential energy  
*Units*: Joules
*Equation*: $$
u= KE+PE
$$
$$ 
E= \frac{3}{2}*n*R*T
$$
R= 8.31 (constant)
T= Temperature 
n= # of moles 

$$
E= \frac{3}{2}*Kb*T
$$

Kb= Boltzmanns constant 
T= Temperature 

## RMS speed (Root Mean Square)
*Definition*: speed of the particles in a gas by finding what speed the *majority* of particles went at. 
*Simple words*: speed that majority of molecules went - average kinetic energy of the gas
*Units*: 
*Measured with:* 
*Equation*: $$
\sqrt{\frac{x^2+y^2+z^2}{3}}
$$
x,y,z= the speeds of the molecules
