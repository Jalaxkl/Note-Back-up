# Guiding Questions 
[[⚪ Physics HL]] #physics 

- How do macroscopic observations provide a model of the microscopic properties of a substance?
- How is energy transferred within and between systems?
- How can observations of one physical quantity be used to determine the other properties of a system?

# Molecular/ Partical Theory 

- In summation this theory explains how the object is in a certain state (solid, liquid or gas)
## Solids 

- In a solid the particles *revolve* around a *fixed* position. There is a *strong* force of attraction between each particle and they are very *close* together. 

- High force that binds them 
- low kinetic energy 

## Liquid 

- In a liquid the particles are *close* together but can move in any direction. They won't keep a *fixed* shape like *solids* do. 

- Higher internal energies 
- higher kinetic energies
- takes the shape of its container. 

## Gas 

- In a gas the particles are very far apart and move *quickly* in all directions they often *collide* with each other and because they are far apart they can easily be *squashed*. 

- Can be compressed 


## Density
*Definition*: The Amount of particles in a unit of space 
*Simple words*: The more density the more mass you have 
*Units*: kgm^-3
*Equation*: $$
Density = \frac{Mass}{ Volume}.....= p=\frac{m}{v}
$$

- Water has a density of 1 kilogram per liter 


# Absolute Temperature 

- "Absolute Temperature" starts at 0K and represents the temperature at which particles have zero kinetic energy. It goes up in the same steps as Celsius 
	- Freezing point of water if 273K
	- Boiling point of water is 373K
	- Room temperature is about 293K

t(K) = t(C) + 273
To find kelvin just add the Celsius + 273

## Molecular speed and Temperature 

- As temperatures increases the kinetic energy of the particles in the substances increases
Expressed mathematically: (end unit of Joules)
$$
Ek =\frac{3}{2} Kb*T
$$
Ek = Average Kinetic Energy 
Kb = **Boltzmann constant** = 1.38x10^-23
T = Temperature in *Kelvin*. 

- On a graph the slope will always be the Boltzman constant 

## Heat and Temperature 

- Heat is a type of energy that will flow from a warm area to a colder one. 
- For example:
	- This cup of coffee will *cool down* because it is *giving out* hear energy into the surroundings. The hotter is it eh quicker it will lose heat. 
	- This drink (taken out of the fridge) will warm up because it is taking in heat from the surrounding air.

## Internal Energy 

- The "Internal Energy" of the gas is the total amount of *kinetic energy and potential energy* of all the gas molecules added together. 
- If a substance is heated its internal energy increases. Causing:
	- 1. Increase in speed of particles (temperature)
	- 2. A change of state (increase of potential energy)

# Specific Heat Capacity  (LE Part 2)

- Specific heat capacity
- Specific latent heat of vaporization and fusion
- Conduction, convection and radiation

## Specific Heat Capacity (c) - for pure state substances 
*Definition*: Amount of Energy needed (to be gained or lost) to change the temperature of 1kg of a substance by 1kg. 

**Any substance that can experience a temperature change will have Specific Heat Capacity.**

*Simple words*: How much energy do we need to remove to change the 1 kg by 1K AND the ability of an object to store heat energy
*Units*: J Kg^-1 K-1
*Equation*: $$
ΔQ=m*c*ΔT

$$

ΔQ = Amount of thermal energy transfered 
m = Mass of liquid (in kg)
c = Specific Heat Capacity (in J/kg K)
ΔT = Change in Temperature (In Kelvin)

#### Another Equation (More important one)
$$
c= \frac{ΔQ}{m*ΔT}
$$


## Thermal Capacity (C)
*Definition*: 
*Simple words*: How much energy to change an objects temperature by one Kelvin  
*Units*: J K^-1 
*Equation*: $$
C = \frac{ΔQ}{ΔT}
$$
## Specific Latent Heat 
*Definition*: Amount of energy needed to change the state of one kilogram of the substance WITHOUT changing its temperature 
*Simple words*: How to change the state of a substance (1 kg of it) without changing temperature 
*Units*: 
*Measured with:* 
*Equation*: $$
Q= m*L
$$
Q = Energy supplied or taken away 
m = mass in kg 
L = Specific Latent heat (in J/kg)
