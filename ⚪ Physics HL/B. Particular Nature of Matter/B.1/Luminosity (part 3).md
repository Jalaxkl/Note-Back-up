# Black Body 

## Perfect Black Body 
*Definition*: Objects that absorbs all wavelengths and incidents and then reflects them all 
*Simple words*: A perfect celestial mirror
*Equation*: 




# Stefan- Boltzmann Law

- The total power P radiated by a perfect black body depends on two factors 
	- Absolute Temperature
	- Surface Area 

## Stefan - Boltzmann Law
*Definition*: The total energy emitted by a black body per unit area per second is proportional to the fourth power of the absolute temperature of the body 
*Simple words*: used to calculate the luminosity of objects such as celestial objects and stars. 
*Units*: 
*Equation*: $$

P= σ*A*T^4
$$
P = total power across all wavelength (W)
σ = Stefan Boltzmann constant 
A = Surface area of the body (m^2)
T = Absolute temperature of the body (K)

- Power radiated in this case is the luminosity 
- ONLY APPLICABLE to a perfect black body 

## Wien Displacement Law 
*Equation*: $$
λmax= 2.90*10^{3} / T
$$


## Solar Constant: 1360watts per M^2 
*Definition*: The amount of energy the sun emits from OUR (earths) position. 
*Simple words*: how much intensity of light earth receives per unit area of the power of the sun.
