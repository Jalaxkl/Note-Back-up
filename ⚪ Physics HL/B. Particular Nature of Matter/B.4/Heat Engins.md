- Useless a Hot source at a high temperature 

- Heat device that is heated up 

- Cold isnk 
	- The dump from the left over energy from the heat source

## What is it?

- A heat engine is a device that will take energy from a hot energy source then do work done on an device by heating it up and then a cold sink will take the rest of the energy left over from this process 

### Carnot Cycle 
- Two Adiabatic process work done makes the gas hot 
- two Isothermal expansion process with work done by gas = heat gains 
- Final Isothermal compression with
