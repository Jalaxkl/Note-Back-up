## Kinetic Energy Equations
*Definition*:
*Simple words*: 
*Units*: 
*Measured with:* 
*Equation*: $$
Kk= \frac{3}{2} 
$$
Change in the eternal Energy:
$$E= \frac{3}{2}*Kb*T$$
E= Change in internal Energy 
Kb = Boltzmanns constant 
T= Change in Temperature 

*Translational kinetic Energy*
$$
E= \frac{3}{2}*n*R*T
$$
n= Amount of substance (moles)
R= 8.31

# Doing Work on a GAS
Imagine you pumping up a ball 
- When the pump is being used there is **work** being done on the enclosed ***gas***. This increases the **internal** energy of the gas and, as such, raises the **temperature**. 
$$Work=Force*Distance$$
Force = Pressure x Area
$$ Work=Preasure*area*Distance Moved$$
area x Distance moved = Volume
$$ Work=Preasure*Volume...W= P*V$$
#### When there is work done on a gas there is a negative Value

# First law of thermodynamics 
**Defintion: Energy is conserved if the amount of heat energy added equals the increase in internal energy + the work done by the gas** 
If the pressure remains constant then you can sub w=3/2NRT
#### When there is work done on a gas there is a negative Value 

Important considerations:
- A positive **Q** (Heat Energy) means that heat energy is transferred **from** the surrounding to the system 
- A positive **U** (Internal Energy) means that the internal energy of the system **increases** 
- A positive **W** (Work done) means that the system does work **on** the surroundings.

# Cyclic Process 

- Q= Thermal Energy 
- U= Internal Energy 
- P= Pressure 
- V= Volume of gas

## Isobaric Process 
*Definition*: Constant Pressure with changes in volume, and temperature. 
*Simple words*: Change carried out at constant pressure 
*Equation*: $$
Q=ΔU+P*ΔV
$$
$$\frac{V}{T}= Constant$$

## Isovolumetric Process
*Definition*: Constant Volume, Increase Pressure, Increase in Temperature, 
*Simple words*: A change carried out at constant volume 
*Equation*: $$
Q=ΔU+P*ΔV=ΔU+P*0
$$
$$
\frac{P}{T}= Constant
$$

- **Work done = 0** 
- gas is getting hotter therefore **internal energy increases** 


## Isothermal Process
*Definition*: When Pressure drops and the Volume increases, Temperature remains constant. 
*Simple words*: A change carried out at constant gas temperature (which is constant thermal energy)
*Equation*:

- All thermal energy transferred into the system and appears as work done by the gas



## Adiabatic Expansion / Compression 
*Definition*: Is one in which there is no exchange of heat between the systems and the surroundings 
- Volume Increases (Therefore Work done is positive) 
- Temperature decreases (Internal energy is negative)
- Q=0 so no heat is exchanged 


*Simple words*: Q = 0 (NO THERMAL ENERGY TRANSFER) A change carred out with no energy transferred to or from the system.  

*Equation*: $$
P*V^{\frac{5}{3}}= Constant 
$$![[Screenshot 2024-03-12 at 8.56.36 PM.png]]

Shape of the curve is given by:$$
y= \frac{1}{x^{\frac{5}{3}}}
$$
