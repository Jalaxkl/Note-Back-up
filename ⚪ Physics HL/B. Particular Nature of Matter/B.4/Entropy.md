# Overview: 
- that entropy can be determined in terms of macroscopic quantities such as thermal energy and temperature as given by Δ_S_ = Δ_Q/T_ and also in terms of the properties of individual particles of the system as given by _S_ = _k_B ln Ω where _k_B is the Boltzmann constant and Ω is the number of possible microstates of the system
- that the second law of thermodynamics refers to the change in entropy of an isolated system and sets constraints on possible physical processes and on the overall evolution of the system

# Second law of thermodynamics

- increasing the order in a system is not a process that happens naturally, it usually goes into chaos 

- Its not possible for heat to be transferred from a cold body to a warm one without work being done 
	- Clausius statment 
		- Transferring heat to a cold body, its impossible to not do any work. 

- It is not possible for a heat engine working in a cycle to absorb thermal energy and convert it all to work 
	- Kelvin - Planck statment 
		- A heat engine going in cycles, it is impossible for the engine to transfer all thermal energy to work

## Entropy 
*Definition*: Measure of the number of possible arrangements of the paticles and their energies
*Simple words*: Randomness is energy (It is not possible to increase the amount of order in a material)

- Entropy of a substance changes during a change in state 
	- Entropy increases when substances melt OR Boils
	- Decreases with substances freeze or condense 
- Entropy increases with more chaos in the particles

Real Isolated System:
- Differences between reversible and irreversible process at the macroscopic level is important 
- Reversible process is defined:
	- A process where there is no overall change in entropy as the system is returned to its original state 
- Irreversible process is defined as:
	- Which results in an increase in entropy as the system cannot be brought back to the original state 

NON-Isolated system 
- While entropy of an isolated system must always decrease 
- Isolated system is defined as:
	- Nothing can be transfered in or out of the system
- Isolated system:
	- Stuff can NOT be transfered in or out 


## Entropy on a **microscopic** level 

*Equation*: 
$$
S=Kb*lnΩ
$$
S= Entropy of the system of microscopic particles (JK)
Kb= Boltzmanns constant
lnΩ = Natural log of ALL Number of possible micro states of the system 


## Change in entropy
*Definition*:
*Simple words*: 
*Units*: 
*Measured with:* 
*Equation*:$$
S=Kb*ln(\frac{Ω2}{Ω1})
$$
kb= boltzmanns constant 
Ω2= Final number of possible micro states 
Ω1= initial number of micro states 

## OMEGA (Ω)
*Definition*: Number of particles 
*Equation*:$$
Ω=\frac{N!}{(N-n)!-n!}
$$
N= Total number of particles 
N= transferred particles
