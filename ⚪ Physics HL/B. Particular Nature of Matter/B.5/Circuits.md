## Circuit Diagrams 
*Definition*: A universal way to visually show a electrical circuit (All shapes are shown on Data Booklet)

### Cells and Batteries 
- A device that converts energy from a chemical energy store to electrical store 
- Direction of current is from the positive to the negative side
- Electron flow goes from the negative side to the positive side 

### Voltmeter & Ammeters 

- A voltmeter is a device which measures the potential difference between two points in a circuit 
	- Potential difference 
	- Always connected in parallel
	- Will have infinitely large amount of resistance (cannot support any current)

- Ammeter is a device which measures the current flowing in a circuit.. 
	- ONLY should be connected in series (not parrallel)
	- Will have infinitely small amounts of resistance 
		- (Ideally would have no resistance or effect on the current)

### Fixed resistor 
- A device which increases resistance to limit the flow of current 

### Variable resistor 
- A device that has a slider that can be used to change the resistance 
- As the resistance of the variable resistor increases, the current in the circuit decreases and vice versa 

### Light dependent resistor 
- The amount of light hitting the sensor then resists so much of the current 

### Potentiometer 
- A resistor with a sliding contact to form an adjustable voltage divider 

### Lamp 
- Light emitting component consisting of heating a filament inside a glass cover 

### Light- Emitting diode (LED)
- A device that emits light when a current passes through it. A diode only allows current to flow in one direction

## Electric Current (I)
*Definition*: Defined as the rate of flow of charge carriers 
*Simple words*: amps in a current, how much charge flows per second 
*Units*: amperes 
*Equation*: $$
I=\frac{q}{t}
$$
I= Current 
q= change in charge 
t= time

- Conventional current 
	- Electrons going from positive to negative 


- DC current 
	- Current only flows in one direction

- AC current
	- Electrons change directions multiple times per second according to the frequency 

- In series circuits the amp value remains the same across the circuit. 


## Potential difference (V)
*Definition*: Measure of the electrical potential energy transfered by an electron moving between two points in a conductor. 
*Simple words*: Voltage difference: force that pushes the electrons 
*Units*: volts (V)
*Equation*: $$
V= \frac{W}{q}
$$
V= Voltage 
W= Work done 
q= unit charge 

- Work done per unit charge on moving a positive charge between two points long the path of the current 
- EMF: Electron motor force 

### Electromotive force 
*Definition*: Toal work done by a cell per coulomb of charge 
Equation: $$
e= $$

## Electron volts
*Definition*: The amount of energy needed to move an electron through a potential different of one volt
*Simple words*: Alternative unit for energy when working with very small charged particles 
*Units*: 
*Equation*: $$
W= V*q
$$
w= work done 
V= potential difference (volts)
q= charge (elementary charge)

- One electron volt is equal to 1.6x10^-19

- Simply divide the work done value by the elementary charge 

## Parallel Circuits  
*Definition*: A circuit where the current has a 'choice of routes'
*Simple words*: different paths stemming from the same origin
*Equation*: 

- Current:
	- Half the current will go each direction or path 
	- Take the original amount of current and then divide by the numbers of paths possible 

- Voltage 
	- The voltage in a parallel circuit STAYS THE SAME across each path 
	- Sum of all volts must equal to 0

## Series Circuits  
*Definition*: A circuit where the current has a one route
*Equation*: 

- Current
	- Same at each point 
	- remains the same throughout 

- Voltage:
	- Splits up over each component  
	- Sums up to the total amount

## Kirchoff's First Law (Junction Law)
*Definition*:  The sum of the currents leave a point is the same as the sum of the currents entering the point
*Simple words*: end and starting current remains the same 
*Units*: Current
*Equation*: $$
I1=I2+I3.....
$$

- Any current flowing away from a junction is deemed as negative 

- Only applicable for parallel circuits and for the current 

## Kirchoff's Second Law (Loop Law) 
*Definition*: Around any closed loop, the sum of the E.m.f.s is equal to the sum of the p.d.s
*Simple words*: Sum of all voltages must equal the power source 
*Units*: Voltage 
*Equation*: $$
V=V1+V2.....
$$

- Only applicable for series circuits  
- The use of voltage will be equally split between all sources (assuming they are equal)


---
## Resistance 
*Definition*: Opposition 
*Simple words*: 
*Units*: 
*Equation*: $$
R= \frac{Restivity*Length}{area}...R=\frac{ρ*L}{A}
$$

ρ= Resistivity (Given) Ohm Meters
L= Length 
A= cross sectional area 

#### OHM's Law
$$
R=\frac{V}{I}
$$
V= Voltage 
I= Current (Amps)


Depends on 3 physical properties
- Length 
	- Directly proportional
- Cross sectional area 
	- Inversly porportional
- Material  


The law only applies when temperature remains constant!
- Temperature
	- Higher temperature = greater resistance
	- Lower temperature = lower resistance 


#### In Series 
- "Current stays the same voltage splits up
- Rt= R1+R2+R3...
	- Sum of all resistance in series

#### In parallel 
- 1/Rt= 1/R1 +1/R2...
- "Voltage stays the same but current splits up"
- Adding the inverses of all the resistances


##### Non-Ohmic conductors 
Examples:
- Bulbs 
	- Gradient of a Voltage over Current graph
		- Would increase (not linear)
	- Resistance increases as the bulb gets brighter (filament gets hotter)
	- As voltage increases the bulb gets hotter and increases resistance 

- Diode (only allows current to flow in one direction)
	- We only take into account the positive (quadrant 1)
	- A diode only lets current go in the 'forward' direction

- Thermistor 
	- Resistance decreases as the (negative-temperature-coefficent) thermistor gets hotter

*Equation*: $$
