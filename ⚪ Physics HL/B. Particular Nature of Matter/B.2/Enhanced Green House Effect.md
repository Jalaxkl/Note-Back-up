# Meet Your Gases:

- Water Vapor
	- Evaporation from the oceans/seas and plants 

- Carbon Dioxide 
	- Volcanic eruptions, wildfires and respiration 

- Methane 
	- emission from oceans and soils as part of decomposition, termites also emit methane.

- Nitrous Oxide 
	- Soils and Oceans 

**Radiation needs to match their natural resonant energy, if not then it will not absorb it.** 
- When radiation from the sun hits the Earth, it is radiated back form the Earth's surface as long-wave radiation. *This is the radiation that bounces off the surface*
	- Long wavelength, short frequency 
		- matches the natural resonant of the greenhouse gases
