# Conservation of Energy 
## Emissivity (e)
- Stars are a good example of black bodies, planets are not. 

*Definition*: The ratio of the power radiated by an objects to the power radiated by a black body of the same surface area and temperature. 

*Simple words*: The ratio of the **power** of an **object and a black body** as long as their are the same temperature and surface area. 

*Units*: Unitless quantity. (Percentage value)
*Equation*: $$
e=  \frac{Power+Emitted+By+an+Object}{Power+Emitted+By+a+Black+Body} 
$$

- For a perfect black body the emissivity is equal to 1 
	- The answer would never go above 1 
		- Because its a percentage value 

#### E = (1-a)
- Emissivity and Albedo are directly proportional. 

**How much an object Absorbs from the outside environment**
### Application: Grey bodies 
#### Grey Bodies 
*Definition*: Using Stephan Blotzman laws 
*Equation*:  $$

P= e*σ*A*T^4
$$
P = total power across all wavelength (W)
e= emissivity of the object
σ = Stefan Boltzmann constant 
A = Surface area of the body (m^2)
T = Absolute temperature of the body (K)


## Albedo (a)
*Definition*: The proportion of light reflected by a given surface. 
*Simple words*: Opposite of Emissivity- How much an object emits
*Units*: Unitless (Percentage value)
*Equation*: $$
Albedo(a)= \frac{Total+Reflected+Power}{Total+Incident+Power}
$$

- Objects with a high albedo are good reflectors (mirrors)

- *Albedo of a planet is defined as:*
	- The ratio between the totaled reflected radiation from the surface of the planet and the total incident radiation on the planet. 

### Application: Earth 
- Earth's albedo is generally take to be 0.3 (emissivity of 0.7) 
	- 30% of the sun rays the reach the ground is reflected.

## Solar Constant 
*Definition*: The amount of power arriving at the atmosphere of the Earth from the Sun per unit area
*Simple words*: the amount of energy arriving to us from the sun per second. 
*Units*: 
*Equation*: $$
I= \frac{L}{4*π*D^2}
$$

- I = Intensity 
- D= Distance from the sun 
- L = luminosity of an object 

#### EARTH'S SOLAR CONSTANT 1380WATTS 
- However we won't feel that because of our atmosphere. 
	- Not including the energy absorbed by the earth but just the power arriving here
