# Torque 

## Pivot/ Fulcrum
*Definition*: The axis at which rotational force acts around 
*Simple words*: Where Torque happens 

- A lever (such as a door handle) decreases the force required and maxim your effort
- The *further away* you go from the pivot the *less force* that will be required to spin it. 
	- **Levers are force multipliers** 

## Center of mass 
*Definition*: The Unique point at which the weighted position vectors all sum up to zero 
*Simple words*: The point where the mass is equal and appears to be concentrated

- Its the point where you can easily balance the object. 
	- *Imaginary* point 

## Moment / Torque 
*Definition*: A 'turning force' 
*Simple words*: The force that turns an object perpendicular to its center of mass 
*Units*: Nm (Newton Meters)
*Equation*: $$ 
τ= Force *Distance$$
- Distance *MUST BE* perpendicular to the force that is being applied 

##### If its not Perpendicular use this:
$$
τ=Force*r*sinθ
$$
- R is the distance of the entire lever 

#### Principle of Moments 
	- If a body is in Equilibrium the sum of the clockwise moments is equal to the sum of the anti-clockwise moments. 


### How to solve Torque Equations 

- Uniform Rod: Mass is evenly distributed and Center of Gravity is in the middle 

- Have both sides of the rotational Torque, Clockwise and Counter Clock Wise equal each other 
	- Solve for what you want 
	- Make sure to add subscripts 

- When forces are perpendicular no need to take into account for angles 

- Take it by simple steps
