# Overview 
- How do reference frames influence the application of Galilean transformations equations, and what role do these equations play in describing motion across different frames of reference 

- Outline reference frames.
- Explain Galilean relativity
- Use the Galilean transformation equations:
          _x'=x−vt and t'=t_   
          
- Know and use the velocity addition equation:
           _u'=u−v_

# Special Relativity 

## Reference Frames 
*Definition*: In terms of motion, reference frames are a system of graduated lines symbolically attached to a body that serve to describe the position of points relative to the body compared to other points. (Britanica)

*Simple words*: How you see an object moving in time 
*Equations*: [[Data Blooklet.pdf]] (Page 7)
- S is usually a stationary object 
- S' (S Prime) is usually with an object that is moving 

- A frame of reference is just a *coordinate system chosen by any observer* 
- The reference frame is then used by the observer to *measure positions* and times so that the positions, velocities, and accelerations can all be *referenced to something* specific 

- **Quick tip**: Draw out the diagram for more comprehensive math

#### Inertial Reference frames
- **Moving at constant velocity** 

- We will not use Reference frames where a object is accelerating 


# Galilean Transformations 

## Transformations in the X Direction 
*Equation*: $$
X'= X-vt...OR...X=X'+vt


$$
X = distance from a stationary point
X'=distance from a moving perspective 

###### Anything with an ' is from the reference point of a MOVING object

- Time stays constant for any event from different reference frames

*Equation*:

# Newtons Postulates 
**According to newton:** " Absolute, true, and mathematical time, of itself, and from its own nature, flows equably without relation to anything external"

*Time can only be said to be absolute when speed is fractional (Very small) compared to the speed to light* 

**If the speed you are working with is comparable (close to) the speed of light, time cannot be considered absolute**


- For example if I see an event happen that occurs over a period of time but I am I space while I witness it, the time will be befferent because *light takes time to travel* 
- Additionally, if I was there with the event my time would be different cause of the light traveling.

# Time Dilation 

- Say you wanted to measure how long it takes light to go from the floor and bounce off the ceiling and back to the floor and you were able to ACCURALTLY measure the time

^ this is what would you get 


- But now what if someone moved the room you were measuing in and measured the light when you were outside the room

^ this is what you would get 


As you can see the light travels further and has a different time when you move an object. 

#### Equation for Time Dialation:
$$
γ= \frac {1} {(\sqrt{1-v^2/c^2})^{}}

$$



# Special Relativity 
- This happens when the speed/velocity IS **comparable** to the speed of light (c)

**New vocab:**
- *Proper time*: Δt0 the change in time from within the reference frame
	- Always shorter than the perceived/observed time (Due to Time Dialation)

- *Proper length*: the Length of an object as measured in its rest frame
	- Always be larger than the perceived length

## Length contraction 
Equation:

$$
L= \frac{Lo}{γ}
$$
L = Perceived length 
Lo= Proper length

# Lorentz transformations

X= Distance (not moving)
X'= Distance traveled
γ= kinda like a constant 
v= velocity traveling 
t= time (absolute time)
c= speed of light

- Finding other data from and relative from one frame to find data as perceived from the other reference frame 
	- *To transform space and time from one reference frame to see how its observed from another reference frame.*
