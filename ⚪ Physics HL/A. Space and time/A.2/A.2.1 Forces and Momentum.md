#### What is a Physical Quantity?
Something that is measurable and is in the real world (not conceptual)

## Scalar 
*Definition:* Are physical quantities that only have a *magnitude* but **NO** *direction* 

**Magnitude** is *size*: Can be measured with a number, like: *Speed, Work, Density Mass, Temp, Time and Distance*
- Usually a short statement without much context cause it does not give direction. 
- Fundamental quantity (doesn't rely on anything)


## Vector 
*Definition:* Physical quantity that has both *magnitude* **AND** *direction* 

Vectors are qualities with *Velocity, Weight, Displacement, Acceleration, Force, and Momentum* 

- Described using arrows 
**----->**
*Length*: Magnitude
*Way its pointing:* Direction 

Negative numbers are indicated on which way to go back


# Intro to forces 

## Force (F)
*Definition*: A force is a [physical quantity] that describes the interaction between bodies 
*Simple words*: A pull or a push 
*Units*: Newtons (N) 
*Measured with:* Newton spring balance or meter
*Equation*: F= ma

- When bodies (objects) interact, forces are experienced by the bodies 
- When bodies stop interacting, the forces stop
- *A force can:*
	- Change the motion of an object - set in motion or stop motion 
	- Change the shape or size of an object 


# Friction
---
## Static Friction  
*Definition*: The Friction of a NON moving object 
*Simple words*: Not moving friction 
*Units*: N
*Equation*: $$ 
Ff < μ*Fn
$$
μ = The Coefficient of friction between the two objects's surface
Fn = Force Normal 
Ff = Force Friction


---
## Kinetic Friction  
*Definition*: The friction an object experience when the object is in motion 
*Simple words*: 
*Units*: N
*Equation*: $$
Ff = μ*Fn
$$
μ = The Coefficient of friction between the two objects's surface
Fn = Force Normal 
Ff = Force Friction


## Relationship between Static and Kinetic 

- Static > Kinetic Friction 
- Static Friction is when an object is not moving, once the object starts moving the (lesser force) of friction takes over ((This creates a NEW coefficient of friction between the two surfaces ))


---
### Types of force 
*Normal Force*: **Reaction** by the solid force to the weight of an object (Normal to the surface 90)
*Friction*: A force acting against anything moving or trying to move 


##### Mass and weight and Inertia 
*Equations*: 
- W = M * G ; weight = mass / gravity 
- M = W / G
- G = W / G

---
# Contact forces 
*Definition*: A force that can cause a change in motion of an object by touching it. 
## Stokes Law (Viscous drag)
*Definition*: When a sphere moves through a liquid with laminar movement 
*Simple words*: Viscous Drag
*Units*: N (friction)
*Equation*: $$ 
Fd = 6*pi*η*r*v
$$
r = radius of the sphere 
v - velocity the sphere is traveling 
η = Viscosity of the fluid (eta) Unit for viscosity: N * M^-2 * s


---
## Buoyancy 
*Definition*: A contact force acting on a body due to the displacement of the fluid
*Simple words*: Floating force ; *Upthrust = weight of fluid is displaced*
*Units*: N (force)
*Equation*: $$ 
Fb = ρ*V*g
$$
The buoyant force = weight of the displaced fluid
- ρ = density (rho)
- V = Volume 
- g = Acceleration due to gravity (9.81)


---
## Tension  
*Definition*: A contact force transmitted through a rope, string or wire when pulled from opposite sides
*Simple words*: Rope force 
*Units*: N (force)
*Equation*: 


---
# Non- Contact force 

## Gravitational Force  
*Definition*: Force of attraction between all bodies of mass ; depends on mass and distance 
*Simple words*: acceleration due to gravity 
*Units*: m/s 
*Measured with:* Fg = 9.81m/s
*Equation*: $$ 
g = 9.81 *N*kg^1
$$
(Newtons Gravitational law used for longer distanced ) 


---
## Electrostatic Force  
*Definition*: A force of attraction or repulsion between charged and non charged objects. 
*Simple words*: Electricity 
*Units*: 
*Measured with:* 
*Equation*: $$ 
Fe = (k*q1*q2)/ r^2
$$
k = 8.99x10^9 
q = Charge on a objects 
r = distance between the two objects 

- Fe is proportional to the product of the two charges 
- Fe is inversely proportional to the seperation of the objects.  


---
## Magnetic Force 
*Definition*: A consequence of the electromagnetic force and is caused by the motion of charges
*Simple words*: Magnets 
*Units*: 
*Measured with:* 
*Equation*: $$
Fe = (G*m1*m2)/r^2
$$
G = 6.67 x10^-11
m1 = mass 1 
m2 = mass 2 
r = distance between objects

# Hooks Laws
Definition:
Equation:
$$ F=-k*x $$
- F= Force 
- K= Spring extension 
- X = force applied

## Used for?
Definition: To find the spring constant of a spring.
