[[⚪ Physics HL]] #physics 

**Learning objectives:**

Students will understand:

- Period, frequency, angular displacement and angular velocity
- Centripetal force
- Centripetal acceleration

Students will be able to:

- Identify the force providing the centripetal force such as tension, friction, gravitational, electrical, or magnetic.
- Solve problems involving centripetal force, centripetal acceleration, period, frequency, angular displacement, linear speed and angular velocity.
- Qualitatively and quantitatively describe examples of circular motion including cases of vertical and horizontal circular motion.

# Circular Motion 

#### 2 things required:

- Net force must be constant and **toward** the Center of the circle 

- There has to be a constant velocity **90 degrees** to the net force


# Vocab 

## Centripetal Force 
*Definition*: The Net force on the object 
*Simple words*: Always points in the center 
Units: N$$
Fc=\frac{m*v^2}{r}
$$

## Tangential Velocity 
*Definition*: The distance the object moves around the circle over change in time 
*Units*: ms^-1
*Equation*: $$
Vt = \frac{d}{t}= \frac{2πr}{t}= 2πr*f
$$


## Centripetal Acceleration 
*Definition*: When change in velocity is towards the centre of the circle
*Simple words*: So acceleration is toward the centre of the circle. 
*Units*: ms^-2 
- Essentially you can't have a change in velocity when going in a circle there is some kind of acceleration which creates a change in Velocity 
Equation: $$ 
Acentripetal= \frac{V^2}{r}= \frac{(2πr*f)^2}{r}
$$


--- 
## Period (T)
*Definition*: The amount of time an object takes to complete one cycle 
*Simple words*: How long it takes for the object to do one full rotation 
*Units*: s
*Equation*: $$ 
T= \frac{1}{f}
$$

## Frequency (f)
*Definition*: The amount of repetions a cycle completes in one second 
*Simple words*: 
*Units*: 
*Measured with:* 
*Equation*: $$
f=\frac{1}{T}
$$


--- 
## Angular Velocity (ω) 
*Definition*: The change in an angle over time 
*Simple words*: how the angles changes with movement around the circle
*Units*: Radians Per second 
Equation:$$
ω= \frac{2π}{ T}= 2π*f
$$
Another Equation$$
v=ω*r
$$
- v= linear velocity 
- r= radius
