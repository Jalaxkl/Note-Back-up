# Equations for Linear Motion 
- Kinda the most important 

## Kinematics  
*Definition*: The branch of physics concerned with the motion of objects without reference to the forces which cause motion 
*Simple words*: Using other parts of motion to get other parts 


| SUVAT              | Variable | Unit  |
| ---------------- | -------- | ----- |
| Displacement      | s        | m     |
| Initial Velocity | u        | ms^-1 |
| Final Velocity   | v        | ms^-1 |
| Acceleration     | a        | ms^-2 |
| Time             | t        | s      |
- If you get any units that are different you should convert

## 3 steps to solve the equations:

#### Step 1:
- Define a direction (positive of negative)
- Keep them consistent 

#### Step 2:
- The acceleration MUST be constant 
- Any other variable can change but not acceleration 
- If you have changing acceleration you must split the problem into other parts

#### Step 3: 
- Use SUVAT and GUESS method 
- Identify the correct equation 
- If you have 3 of the 4 you can solve for another 

##### Note: When working with free fall 'a' becomes 'g' due to gravitational acceleration

# Different Equations:


**1:**
$$ 
v = u+a*t
$$
(Cannot be used to calculate displacement)

**2:**
$$
s = u*t+\frac{1}{2}a*t^2
$$
(Cannot find Final Velocity)

**3:**
$$
v^{2}=u^{2}+2*a*s
$$
(Cannot calculate time)

**4:**
$$
s= \frac{(u+v)t}{2}
$$
(Constant acceleration)
