#### Work done  = Change in potential energy 
## Electron Volt
*Definition*: Work done on an electron as it moves though a potential difference of 1Volt
*Simple words*: 
*Units*: 
*Measured with:* 
*Equation*: $$
W=q*V
$$
W = work done (transfer of energy) (Joules)
q= Charge of an electron (1.6x10^-19)
V= volts

- We find Electron volt by taking the work done and diving by the **elementary charge**

## Electric Potential (V)
*Definition*: Electric potential at a point is the work done in brining a unit positive test charge from infinity to a point. 
*Simple words*: Work done PER unit charge 
*Units*: (V) volts or potential difference 
*Measured with:* 
*Equation*: $$

V=\frac{W}{q}...V=\frac{kQ}{r}
$$
Kk= Constant 
Q= Charge of field we are bringing in the test charge (Charge of electrical field)
r= Seperation distance 


## Electric Potential Energy (EPE)
*Definition*: Electric Potential Energy is the work done on a charge while moving from an infinite distance from an electric field to a specific point in that electric field.
*Simple words*: Work done from bringing a charge into a field from an infinite distance 
*Units*: Potential Energy (Joules)
*Equation*: $$
E= \frac{K*Q1*q2}{r}
$$
k= constant 
Q1= Charge of the field 
q2= Charge of particle moving into the field (or away for attraction)
r= seperation distance 


### In terms of parallel plates: 

$$
\Delta V =E*d
$$


## Work done on a charge or/by an electric field 
*Definition*: 
*Simple words*: 
*Units*: 
*Measured with:* 
*Equation*: $$
W= q*E*d*cos0
$$
q= Charge of test charge on which the work is done
E= Electric field strength 
d= displacement of the charge due to the work done 
cos0= angle between the displacement and 

$$
W =q*\Delta V
$$
q= charge of particle 
V= potential difference 


## Potential Difference  
*Definition*: change of potential energy (from point A to B) per unit charge 
*Simple words*: Change in electrical potential 
*Units*: Delta V (Change in V)
*Measured with:* 
*Equation*: $$
V=\frac{\Delta PE}{q}
$$
PE = Potential energy 
q= Charge 

- To find on a V/R Graph its the tangential slope 

- A negative sign shows that potential is decreasing 



## Equipotential Points
*Definition*: The potential the charge has radially from a point
*Simple words*: How far a charge is from a point, if they are the same radius then they have the same amount of potential 


## Equipotential Lines
*Definition*: They show the resultant forces of the electrical lines 
*Simple words*: Will always cross to be perpendicular to each other 
*Units*: 
*Measured with:* 
*Equation*:
