# Charges

## Coulomb's Law 
*Definitions*: Gives the magnitude of and direction of the electrostatic force between two charged objects
*Equation*: $$
F= K*\frac{q1*q2}{r^2}
$$
F= Force of attraction 
K= Coulomb Constant 
q1= charge of object 1 
q2= charge of object 2 
r= the straight line distance between two objects. 

If F is negative object attract 
If F is positive objects repel 

Value for acceleration reduces with the separation of the charged particles 

Alpha Particle 
- Helium nucleus 

## Electric Field Strength (E)
- A region in space in which an electrical charge 'feels' force
*Definition*: 
*Simple words*: How strong is the electric field at a certain point?

- Larger field strength means there is a larger force 

*Units*: N C^-1
*Measured with:* 
*Equation*: $$
E= \frac{F}{q}
$$
F= Electrostatic force acting on the charge
q= Charge 

#### ONLY APPLIED TO POINT CHARGES 

## Point charge

	- negligible volume 
	- no size of shape 
	- conservation of electric charge 
	- all the charge is concentrated at a single point
	- Has a electrical field 
	- gravity has no effect (means no mass)

*Definition*: Around a point charge the electric field lines are directly radially inwards or outwards 
*Simple words*: Positive field lines and radially outwards, Negative field lines are radially inwards. 

## Electrical field between Parallel plates

*Definition*: the measure of field strength strength between two plates
*Units*: V/m
*Equation*: $$
E=\frac{V}{d}
$$
E= Electrical field strength 
V= Potential difference between plates (V)
d= separation distance of the plates (m)



## Electrical field in a hollow sphere

*Definition*: The field strength around a hollow sphere (or cylinder) 
*Units*: 
*Equation*:

- Inside the sphere there is no electrical charge 

- The field extends radially outward (normal from the surface) outside of the hollow sphere.
