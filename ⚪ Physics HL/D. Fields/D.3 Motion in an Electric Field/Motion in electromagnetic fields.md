**_Students will understand:_** 

- the motion of a charged particle in a uniform electric field
- the motion of a charged particle in a uniform magnetic field
- the motion of a charged particle in perpendicularly orientated uniform electric and magnetic fields
- the magnitude and direction of the force on a charge moving in a magnetic field as given by _F_ = _qvB_ sin _θ_
- the magnitude and direction of the force on a current-carrying conductor in a magnetic field as given by _F_ = _BΙL_ sin _θ_
- the force per unit length between parallel wires as given by _F/L_ = _μ_0(_I__1I2)_/ 2_πr_ where _r_ is the separation between the two wires.

## Force on a Conductor (Motor Effect)
*Definition*: How much force does a magnetic field produce onto a current carrying wire
*Simple words*: A current- carrying conductor produces its own magnetic field 
*Measured with:* 
*Equation*: $$
F=B*I*L*sin\theta 
$$
F= Force acting on the conductor (N)
B= Magnetic Flux density (magnetic field strength) ((By Definition, 1T produces a froce of 1N on 1M long wire with a current of 1A))
I= Current
L= Length of the conductor 

Equation shows:
- Increasing the strength of the magnetic field increase force of the conductor

##### Representing Magnetic fields in 3D

**Dots**: A magnetic field directed OUT of the plane 

**Cross**: Represent the magnetic field directed INTO the plane on the page

## Force Between Two Parallel Conductors 
*Definition*: A current carrying conductor produces a magnetic field around it
*Simple words*: 
*Units*: 
*Measured with:* 
*Equation*: Ratio of F/L Force per unit length$$
\frac{F}{L}= \mu0\frac{I1*I2}{2*\pi*r}
$$
F= Force applied by the two parallel wires 
L= Length of each parallel conductor 
u(Mu)0= Permeability of free space
I1= Current in wire 1 
I2= Current in wire 2
r= distance between the two conductors 


- Field direction depends on the current direction of the wire: *Right Hand Grip Rule*

## Magnetic Force on a charge 
*Definition*: A moving charge produces its own magnetic field 
*Simple words*: When interacting with an applied magnetic field it will experience a force
*Units*: N
*Equation*: $$
F= B*e*v*\sin\theta
$$
F = Magnetic force 
B= Magnetic flux density (T)
e= Charge of the particle (Elementary charge)
v= speed of the particle 

- The current direction and the velocity are the same

- Direction of flow is current 
- Direction of the magnetic field 

- Second figer represents the current flow 
	- Positive charge, current flows in the same direction 
	- Negative charge, current flows in the opposite direction

## Charged particles in a magnetic field 
*Definition*: Charged particles always travel in a circular path 
*Simple words*: The magnetic force BECOMES the centripital force
*Units*: 

*Equation*: $$
\frac{m*v^2}{r}=B*e*v
$$
$$ 
r= \frac{m*v}{B*e}
$$

r= radius of the path (m)
m= mass of the particle (kg)
v= linear velocity of the particles (m/s)
B= magnetic field strength (T)
e= charge of the particle (C)

- Larger circles
	- Particles with high speeds 
	- Greater mass
- Smaller circles 
	- Greater charge 
	- strong magnetic field strength
