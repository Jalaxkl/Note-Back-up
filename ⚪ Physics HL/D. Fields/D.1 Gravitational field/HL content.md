# Gravitational Potential Energy

## Gravitational Potential (V)
*Definition*: The work done per unit mass in bringing a test mass from infinity to a defined point. 
*Simple words*: Brining the point from infinity to the directed point. Scalar quantity 
*Units*: Capital V 
*Equation*: $$
V=-\frac{G*M}{r}
$$
V= Gravitational potential (Jkg^-1)
G= Gravitational Constant 
M= Mass of body producing the gravitational field 
r= seperation distance from centre of masses. 

**Why is it negative?**
- It is defined as having a value of 0 at infinity 
- Since gravitational force is attractive, work must be done **on** a mass to reach infinity. 


- On the surface of a mass (on a planet) gravitational potential has a negative value 
- The value becomes less negative increases, with distance from that mass
- Work has to be done against the gravitational pull of the planet to take a unit of mass away from the mass

**Gravitational potential at a point depends on:**
- Mass of the object 
- Distance from the CENTRE of mass of the object 



## Gravitational Potential Energy 
(Non-uniform field)
*Definition*: The work done to assemble the system from infinite separation of the components of the system. 
*Simple words*: How much work it is to assemble a object together
*Units*: 
*Equation*: $$
\Delta W= m\Delta V 
$$
W= work done 
m= mass of the object 
V= change in gravitational potential energy 

 Gravitational potential energy of a point mass
 - The work done in brining a mass from infinity to a point 


## Gravitational potential energy 
(Uniform Field)
*Definition*: The change in gravitation potential energy on the surface of a planet)
*Simple words*: 
*Units*: 
*Equation*: $$
E=Mg\Delta h
$$
E= Energy gained
M= Mass 
G= acceleration due to gravity (9.81 on earth)
H= change in height

- Only from close distances from the surface 

- Near the surface the Earth surface is approximated to be uniform 
- Away from earth it field is considered radial as earth is a sphere. 

More better equation:
$$
w= -\frac{G*m1*m2}{r}
$$
m1= Mass of object producing the field 
m2= mass of object moving around the fiend 
r- distance between the centre 
G= gravitational constant 


##### Graph:
- Area under a Force Distance Graph is the work done 

### Change in gravitational potential energy 

$$
V= GM(\frac{1}{r1}-\frac{1}{r2})
$$

r1= First distance from the centre of mass 
r2= second distance form the centre of mass

- Change in gravitational potential 


## Gravitational Potential gradient 
*Definition*: The Gravitational field as a particular point is equal to the negative gradient of a potential-distance graph at that point 
*Simple words*: variation of gravitational potential at different point 
*Units*: 
*Measured with:* 
*Equation*: $$
g=-\frac{\Delta V}{r}
$$

- Defined by equipotential lines 

- Key features of the graph
	- All Values of V are negative (gravitational potential)
	- As r increase (seperation from the center increase), V against r follows a -1/r relation
	- The gradient of the graph at any particular point is the value of g at that point 
- The graph has a shallow increase as r increases 
- the calculate g, draw a tangent line (find the derivative) 
- Graphical representation: $$
  V=-\frac{G*M}{r}
  $$

## Gravitational Equipotential Surfaces 
##### Uniform Field
Only close distances 

- The lines are:
	- Horzontal Straight lines 
	- Parallel 
	- Equally spaced 
	- UNIFORM all the same 
- Potential gradient is defined by the equipotential lines
- No Work is done when moving along an equipotential line 
	- This means an object travelling along on equipotential line doesn't gain or lose an energy $\Delta$ V= 0

##### Radial Lines

Far distances from earth 

- They are always:
	- Concentric circles around the planet 
	- Become further apart, further away from the planet 
	- Follow the radius of the circle 
	- Perpendicular to the gravitational field lines 
		- Represented by dotted lines

# Speeds in Orbit, Orbital Motion and Energy

## Escape Speed 
*Definition*: The minimum speed that will allow an object to escape a gravitational field with no further energy input. 
*Simple words*: How fast an object goes to escape gravity
*Units*: 
*Equation*: Calculated by equating two equations$$
\frac{1}{2}*m*v^{2} = \frac{G*M*m}{r}
$$m= Mass of object in the gravitaional field
v= velocity
G= Gravitational constant 
M= Mass of object producing gravitational field 
r= distance from the centre of mass

**Which simplifies to: $$
V= (\frac{2*G*M}{r})^\frac{1}{2}
$$
V= Escape Velocity 
G= Gravitational constant 
M= Mass of object producing gravitational field
r= distance from the centre of mass


- To escape a gravitational field, a mass must travel at, or above the minimum escape speed
	- Dependent on the mass of the object producing the gravitational field and the radius of that object 

- The same for all masses in the same gravitational field 
	- Tennis ball and rocket have the same required escape speed on earth

- Escape speed of an object is when all the kinetic energy has been transferred to gravitational potential energy 

- Escape velocity is not the velocity needed to escape of the planet but to escape the planets gravitational field altogether 
	- VERY LARGE DISTANCE FROM THE PLANET 
	- Essentially the speed needed to ENTIERLY escape all gravitational forces from the object 

--- 

## Orbital Velocity
*Definition*: The speed at which an object orbits around a planet. 
*Equation*: Equating these two $$
\frac{G*M*m}{r^{2}}= \frac{m*v^2}{r}
$$
Gets this equation:
$$ 
V= (\frac{G*M}{r})^\frac{1}{2}
$$
V= Orbital Velocity 
G= Gravitational constant 
M= Mass of the object being orbited 
r= Seperation from the centre 

- Gravitational force provides a centripetal force which is why planets orbit one another
	- Gravitational force and centripetal force are perpendicular 
	- Fg= Fcentripetal 

- All objects whatever their mass, will travel at the same speed v in a particular orbit radius r

- Energy of an orbiting satellite 
	- Follows a circular path around the planet 
	- Total energy is always constant 
		- Calculated by Kinetic + Gravitational potential 
	- This means kinetic and potential energy are constant at the same particular point 
		- Orbital radius decrease, kinetic energy increase, potential decrease
		- Orbital radius increase, kinetic energy decrease, potential increase

##### Effects of Drag on Orbital Motion 

- Satellites under 600km from the surface may be affected by viscous drag or air resistance 
- Usually small, but over time it will effect the height and speed of the orbit
- Satellites traveling through thin layers of the upper atmosphere will lose some small amount of kinetic energy 
	- Orbital radius decreases 
- If the overall decrease in potential energy is larger than the increase in kinetic energy, the total energy will decrease.
