# Keplers Laws of Planetary motion 

## First Law
*Definition*: The orbit of a planet is elliptical with the sun as one focus 
*Simple words*: The orbit of a planet is a ellipse, with the Sun at one of the two foci 


## Second Laws Describes motion of all planets around the sun
*Definition*: A line joining a planet to the sun would sweep out equal areas in equal time periods
*Simple words*: If I drew a line after a time period in two different parts of the elliptical path, the same area in the triangle would be covered 

- Planets move faster nearer the fun and slower further away from it. 


## Third Law (True for anything orbiting anything)
*Definition*: T^2 (the time for one orbit) is proportional to r^3 (radius of the orbit)
*Simple words*: For plants or satellites in a circular orbit about the same central body, the square of the time period is proportional to the cube of the radius of the orbit
 
*Equation*: $$

T^2=\frac{4\pi^2*r^{3}}{G*m}.........T^2=r^3
$$
T= Orbital time 
r= Orbital radius 
G= Gravity constant 
m= mass of the object being orbited
