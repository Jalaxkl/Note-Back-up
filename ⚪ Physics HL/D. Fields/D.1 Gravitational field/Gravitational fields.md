**_Students will understand:_**

- Newton's universal law of gravitation as given by _F_ = _Gm_1_m_2 / _r_2  for bodies treated as point masses
- conditions under which extended bodies can be treated as point masses
- that gravitational field strength _g_ at a point is the force per unit mass experienced by a small point mass at that point as given by _g_ = _F / m_ = _GM / r_2
- gravitational field lines.
- Kepler’s three laws of orbital motion

# Gravitational Fields 

- All objects with mass attract one another, there is NO repulsive force
- This force is known as the 'force due to gravity' or the weight 
- The Earth's gravitational field is responsible for all weight on earth 

## Gravitational field  
*Definition*: A region of space where a test mass is placed in the region it will experience a gravitational force of attraction. 
*Simple words*: The space surrounding all objects 
*Units*: 
*Equation*: 

- Direction of the gravitational field is always towards the centre of the mass 
- Always attractive has an infinite range, purely depends on the mass. 


### Point Mass Approximation 
*Definition*: The force between two objects is so large the dimensions of the objects is neglected (used when comparing radius)
*Simple words*: The Earth is compared a point mass when comparing the size of the sun. Humans are point masses compared to earth 


### Gravitational Field Lines
Nearly identical to electical field lines

- Radial Fields are considered non-uniform field lines 
- The strength of the fields force on other masses is different depending on how far an object is form the centre of mass of the spere. 
- Assuming mass is concentrated about the centre 
- Represented the action of gravitational force between masses, the direction of these forces can be shown using vectors. 
- Direction of the vector shows the direction of the force 
- The force of gravity remains the same on all objects at the same distance from the centre 

## Newtons law of gravitation 
*Definition*:Gravitational attraction between two objects is proportional to the product of their masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them
*Simple words*: Anything with mass attracts anything else with mass 

*Equation*: $$
F=G \frac{m1*m2}{r^2}
$$
f= gravitational force between two objects 
G= gravitational constant 
m1, m2= Mass of the two objects (in kg)
r= distance from the centre of the masses

# Field Strength

## Gravitational Field Strength 
*Definition*: Force per unit mass experienced by a test mass at that point
*Equation*: $$
g= \frac{G*M}{r^2}
$$
(Gotten from two equations f=ma and the newtons law of gravitation)

g= Gravitational Field Strength 
M= mass of the body causing the field 
G= Gravitational constant
r= distance from the mass

- Factors that effect 
	- Radius (or diameter) of the planet 
	- Mass (or density) of the planet 


- Depends only on the mass of the body causing the field 
- Objects in the same field will experience the same force 
- Inversely proportional to the radial distance of the objects
