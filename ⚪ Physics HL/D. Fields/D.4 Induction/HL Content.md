- that a time-changing magnetic flux induces an emf ε as given by Faraday’s law of induction ε = − N(ΔΦ/Δt)
- that a uniform magnetic field induces an emf in a straight conductor moving perpendicularly to it as given by ε = BvL
- that the direction of induced emf is determined by Lenz’s law and is a consequence of energy conservation
    
- that a uniform magnetic field induces a sinusoidal varying emf in a coil rotating within it

## Induced EMF
*Formal Definition*: The amount of work done per unit charge in separating the charges to the ends of the conductor 
- If the ends of the conductors are connected to a closed circuit an *Induced current* will be able to flow

*Alternative definition*: The process in which an EMF or current in induced in a closed circuit due to changes in the magnetic flux (Magnetic field)

	Definition: Phenomenon which occurs when an EMF due to relative movement between a conductor and magnetic field 
*Simple words*: The direction of current when moving into a magnetic field 
*Units*: Volts
*Measured with:* 
*Equation*: $$
\epsilon= B*L*v
$$

*For a coil of wires: $$
\epsilon= N*B*L*v
$$

N= # of turns on the coil 
e (epsilon) = Induced EMF 
B= magnetic field strength (magnetic flux density)
L= Length of the conductor INSIDE the field 
v= Velocity of the conductor traveling through the field 

Induced EMF increase 
- If the velocity is greater 
- Magnetic field strength is greater 
- Length INSIDE the field is longer 
- More coils in the wires 


The movement must CUT or intersect perpendicularly the field lines to induce a current

- Occurs when:
	- Conductor moves relative to a magnetic field 
	- A magnetic field varies through magnetic field lines. 
- When a conductor cuts through magnetic field lines 
	- Free electrons experience a magnetic force 
	- Work is done onto the electrons, 
		- Mechanical work transferred into electric potential 

- A **potential difference** created between the ends of the conductor, EMF s **induced**

## Magnetic Flux $\Phi$
*Definition*: The product of the magnetic flux density and the cross sectional area perpendicular to the direction of the magnetic flux density 
Magnetic flux density = Magnetic field strength 

*Simple words*: Magnetic flux is the number of magnetic field lines through a given area  
*Units*: Weber (Wb)
*Measured with:* 
*Equation*: $$ 
\Phi = B*A*cos\theta 
$$

$\Phi$ = Magnetic flux (wb) 
B= Magnetic flux density (Magnetic field strength) (T)
A = Cross sectional area (Angle of the field lines and normal line)
	![[Screenshot 2024-09-16 at 9.10.37 AM.png]]
Maximum = cos($\theta$)= 0 as then its 1 
Minimum when cos($\theta$) = 90 as then its 0 

How does angle effect this?
- Maximum when the field lines are perpendicular to the plane of the area 
- It is zero when the magnetic field lines are parallel to the plane of the area

## Magnetic Flux Linkage 
*Definition*: The products of the magnetic flux and the numbers of turns of the coil
*Simple words*: The effect of coils of wires and solenoids 
*Units*: weber
*Equation*: $$ \Phi =B*A*N*Cos\theta
$$
$\Phi$ N= Magnetic Flux linkage 
N= Number of turns in the coil 
B= Magnetic flux density 
A= Cross sectional area 

- Assumes the connected areas are equal in area and link together in uniform 

- More coils on a wire the larger the EMF is induced 

- Same as magnetic flux but with number of coils (See above)

- Changes with the rotation of the coil. 
	- Maximum when the field lines are perpendicular to the place of the area they are passing through.

## Faraday's Law of induction 
*Definition*: The magnitude of an induced emf is directly proportional to the rate of change of magnetic flux linkage 
*Simple words*: 
*Units*: 
*Measured with:* 
*Equation*: $$
\epsilon= \frac{N\Delta\Phi}{\Delta t}
$$
e= Epsilon = Induced Emf 
N$\Delta$ $\Phi$ = Change in magnetic Flux Linkage 
$\Delta$ t= time interval 

- Connects the rate of change of magnetic flux linkage with induced EMF

- There is no Emf induced when there is no cutting of field lines (no change in magnetic flux linkage)

- When a coil is completely horizontal 
	- Any slight change creates a induced Emf 
	- This has the greatest change of Emf as it goes from 0 to any positive number 

- Essentially below the first photo shows a minimal change of magnetic flux linkage 
- The second photo shows the maximum change as it goes from 0 to any number (a larger change in magnetic flux linkage. )

## Lenz's Law (Building off from Faraday's law)
*Definition*: The induced EMF is such that it will oppose the change that causes it. 
*Simple words*: Fixing the equation from above 
*Units*: weber
*Equation*: $$\epsilon= -\frac{N*\Delta\Phi}{\Delta t}$$

This equation shows:
- When a bar magnet goes through a coil an EMF is induced within a coil in a magnetic flux 
- The current is also induced which means the coil has its own magnetic field.
- The coil's magnetic field does not match the bar magnet

# Self Induction & Mutual Induction 

- Self Induction - Induction in the same circuit 
- Mutual induction - Induction between circuits. 

- Both occur as a consequence of lenz's Law 

## Self Induction 
*Definition*: The effect in which a change in the current tends to produce an induced emf which opposes the change of current in the same circuit. 
*Simple words*: 
*Units*: 
*Equation*:

- Induced current is produced by a back EMF

## Mutual Induction 
*Definition*: The effect in which a change in the current in one circuit tends to produce an induced EMF which opposes the change of current in the neighboring circuit. 
*Simple words*: Creating a current with currents that are close to one another as they induce EMF's in each other 

*Measured with:* 
*Equation*: 

- Applied in transformers 

### Transformers
*Definition*: A device that changes high alternating voltage at low current to low alternating voltage at high current

- Designed to reduce heat loss which transmitting electricity through power lines 
- Lower voltage means higher current 
- Higher voltage means lower current 

- Made up of
	- A primary coil 
	- Secondary coil (they cannot have the same # of turns)
	- An Iron core

#### Step up Transformer:
- Secondary col has more turns than the primary coil 
- Secondary voltage is larger than the primary voltage 

#### Step down Transformer 
- Primary coil has more turns 
- Primary voltage is larger than the secondary 

IN an ideal world:
- Your input and output POWER (I * V) will always be equal
