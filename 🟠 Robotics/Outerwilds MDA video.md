# Script 

[ Introduction to the game (in the menu)]

- Mobius digital in 2019 
- Follows a hearthian, a fictitious species exploring their own solar system. The game follows the player as they receive a spaceship and explore the system stuck in a 22 minutes time-loop. Through repeated attempts they investigate alien ruins of a past species occupying the planet and their history with the cause of the time-loop

[ Start a few game and go through the tutorial ]

- All surface features 
- Dialogue 
- Radio frequency driver
- Introduction to the spaceship 

[ Inside the space ship ] 

- signalscope
- Thruster control 
- Landing 
- Computer
- Probe
- Autopilot

- Showcase different physics 
- Different gravity features

[ Introduction to the spacesuit features ]

- Flying 
- Fuel 
- Oxygen (trees)
- Reading dialogue 

[ All different planets ]

- Physics in the game is a major mechanic 
- Reading (THIS IS THE STORYLINE)
	- Can be read from all directions (perepective is chosen not standard)
- Exploration 
- Some planets have storms that move you and your ship around 
	- All the way to throwing your ship into space with you stuck on its surface
